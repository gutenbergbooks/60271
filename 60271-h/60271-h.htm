among the two or three greatest achievements of the twentieth century. This little
book attempts to give, in popular form, an account of this work. As, however, Einstein&#x2019;s
work is so largely dependent upon the work of Newton and Newton&#x2019;s successors, the
first two chapters are devoted to the latter.

<p>&#x201c;This is the most important result obtained in connection with the theory of gravitation

<p>&#x201c;It surpasses in boldness everything previously suggested in speculative natural philosophy

<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd29e309"><span class="xd29e309init">I</span>n speaking of Newton we are tempted to paraphrase a line from the Scriptures: Before
Newton the Solar System was without form, and void; then Newton came and there was
light. To have discovered a law not only applicable to matter on this earth, but to
the planets and sun and stars beyond, is a triumph which places Newton among the super-men.
</p>
<p>What Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation must have meant to the people of his day can be pictured
only if we conceive what the effect upon us would be if someone&#x2014;say Marconi&#x2014;were actually
to succeed in getting into touch with beings on another planet. Newton&#x2019;s law increased
confidence in the universality of earthly laws; and it strengthened belief in the
cosmos as a law-abiding mechanism.
</p>
<p><i>Newton&#x2019;s Law.</i> The attraction between any two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance that separates them. This is the concentrated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>form of Newton&#x2019;s law. If we apply this law to two such bodies as the sun and the earth,
we can state that the sun attracts the earth, and the earth, the sun. Furthermore,
this attractive power will depend upon the distance between these two bodies. Newton
showed that if the distance between the sun and the earth were doubled the attractive
power would be reduced not to one-half, but to one-fourth; if trebled, the attractive
power would be reduced to one-ninth. If, on the other hand, the distance were halved,
the attractive power would be not merely twice, but four times as great. And what
is true of the sun and the earth is true of every body in the firmament, and, as Professor
Rutherford has recently shown, even of the bodies which make up the solar system of
the almost infinitesimal atom.
</p>
<p>This mysterious attractive power that one body possesses for another is called &#x201c;gravitation,&#x201d;
and the law which regulates the motion of bodies when under the spell of gravitation
is the law of gravitation. This law we owe to Newton&#x2019;s genius.
</p>
<p><i>Newton&#x2019;s Predecessors</i>. We can best appreciate Newton&#x2019;s momentous contribution to astronomy by casting a
rapid glance over the state of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>science prior to the seventeenth century&#x2014;that is, prior to Newton&#x2019;s day. Ptolemy&#x2019;s
conception of the earth as the center of the universe held undisputed sway throughout
the middle ages. In those days Ptolemy was in astronomy what Aristotle was in all
other knowledge: they were the gods who could not but be right. Did not Aristotle
say that earth, air, fire and water constituted the four elements? Did not Ptolemy
say that the earth was the center around which the sun revolved? Why, then, question
further? Questioning was a sacrilege.
</p>
<p>Copernicus (1473&#x2013;1543), however, did question. He studied much and thought much. He
devoted his whole life to the investigation of the movements of the heavenly bodies.
And he came to the conclusion that Ptolemy and his followers in succeeding ages had
expounded views which were diametrically opposed to the truth. The sun, said Copernicus,
did not move at all, but the earth did; and far from the earth being the center of
the universe, it was but one of several planets revolving around the sun.
</p>
<p>The influence of the church, coupled with man&#x2019;s inclination to exalt his own importance,
strongly tended against the acceptance of such heterodox views. Among the many hostile
critics of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>Copernican system, Tycho Brahe (1546&#x2013;1601) stands out pre-eminently. This conscientious
observer bitterly assailed Copernicus for his suggestion that the earth moved, and
developed a scheme of his own which postulated that the planets revolved around the
sun, and planets and sun in turn revolved around the earth.
</p>
<p>The majority applauded Tycho; a small, very small group of insurgents had faith in
Copernicus. The illustrious Galileo (1564&#x2013;1642) belonged to the minority. The telescope
of his invention unfolded a view of the universe which belied the assertions of the
many, and strengthened his belief in the Copernican theory. &#x201c;It (the Copernican theory)
explains to me the cause of many phenomena which under the generally accepted theory
are quite unintelligible. I have collected arguments for refuting the latter, but
I do not venture to bring them to publication.&#x201d; So wrote Galileo to his friend, Kepler.
&#x201c;I do not venture to bring them to publication.&#x201d; How significant of the times&#x2014;of any
time, one ventures to add.
</p>
<p>Galileo did overcome his hesitancy and published his views. They aroused a storm.
&#x201c;Look through my telescope,&#x201d; he pleaded. But the professors would not; neither would
the body of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>Inquisitors. The Inquisition condemned him: &#x201c;The proposition that the sun is in the
center of the earth and immovable from its place is absurd, philosophically false
and formally heretical; because it is expressly contrary to the Holy Scriptures.&#x201d;
And poor Galileo was made to utter words which were as far removed from his thoughts
as his oppressors&#x2019; ideas were from the truth: &#x201c;I abjure, curse and detest the said
errors and heresies.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The truth will out. Others arose who defied the majority and the powerful Inquisition.
Most prominent of all of these was Galileo&#x2019;s friend, Kepler. Though a student of Tycho,
Kepler did not hesitate to espouse the Copernican system; but his adoption of it did
not mean unqualified approval. Kepler&#x2019;s criticism was particularly directed against
the Copernican theory that the planets revolve in circles. This was boldness in the
extreme. Ever since Aristotle&#x2019;s discourse on the circle as a perfect figure, it was
taken for granted that motion in space was circular. Nature is perfect; the circle
is perfect; hence, if the sun revolves, it revolves in circles. So strongly were men
imbued with this &#x201c;perfection,&#x201d; that Copernicus himself fell victim. The sun no longer
moved, but the earth and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>planets did, and they moved in a circle. Radical as Copernicus was, a few atoms of
conservatism remained with him still.
</p>
<p>Not so Kepler. Tycho had taught him the importance of careful observation,&#x2014;to such
good effect, that Kepler came to the conclusion that the revolution of the earth around
the sun takes the form of an ellipse rather than a circle, the sun being stationed
at one of the foci of the ellipse.
</p>
<p>To picture this ellipse, we shall ask the reader to stick two pins a short distance
apart into a piece of cardboard, and to place over the pins a loop of string. With
the point of a pencil draw the loop taut. As the pencil moves around the two pins
the curve so produced will be an ellipse. The positions of the two pins represent
the two foci.
</p>
<p>Kepler&#x2019;s observation of the elliptical rotation of the planets was the first of three
laws, quantitatively expressed, which paved the way for Newton&#x2019;s law. Why did the
planets move in just this way? Kepler tried to answer this also, but failed. It remained
for Newton to supply the answer to this question.
</p>
<p><i>Newton&#x2019;s Law of Gravitation.</i> The Great Plague of 1666 drove Newton from Cambridge to his home in Lincolnshire.
There, according to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>celebrated legend, the philosopher sitting in his little garden one fine afternoon,
fell into a deep reverie. This was interrupted by the fall of an apple, and the thinker
turned his attention to the apple and its fall.
</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that Newton &#x201c;discovered&#x201d; gravity. Apples had been seen to
fall before Newton&#x2019;s time, and the reason for their return to earth was correctly
attributed to this mysterious force of attraction possessed by the earth, to which
the name &#x201c;gravity&#x201d; had been given. Newton&#x2019;s great triumph consisted in showing that
this &#x201c;gravity,&#x201d; which was supposed to be a peculiar property residing in the earth,
was a universal property of matter; that it applied to the moon and the sun as well
as to the earth; that, in fact, the motions of the moon and the planets could be explained
on the basis of gravitation. But his supreme triumph was to give, in one sublime generalization,
quantitative expression to the motion regulating heavenly bodies.
</p>
<p>Let us follow Newton in his train of thought. An apple falls from a tree 50 yards
high. It would fall from a tree 500 yards high. It would fall from the highest mountain
top several miles above sea level. It would probably fall from a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>height much above the mountain top. Why not? Probably the further up you go the less
does the earth attract the apple, but at what distance does this attraction stop entirely?
</p>
<p>The nearest body in space to the earth is the moon, some 240,000 miles away. Would
an apple reach the earth if thrown from the moon? But perhaps the moon itself has
attractive power? If so, since the apple would be much nearer the moon than the earth,
the probabilities are that the apple would never reach the earth.
</p>
<p>But hold! The apple is not the only object that falls to the ground. What is true
of the apple is true of all other bodies&#x2014;of all matter, large and small. Now there
is the moon itself, a very large body. Does the earth exert any gravitational pull
on the moon? To be sure, the moon is many thousands of miles away, but the moon is
a very large body, and perhaps this size is in some way related to the power of attraction?
</p>
<p>But then if the earth attracts the moon, why does not the moon fall to the earth?
</p>
<p>A glance at the accompanying figure will help to answer this question. We must remember
that the moon is not stationary, but travelling at tremendous speed&#x2014;so much so, that
it circles the entire earth every month. Now if the earth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>were absent the path of the moon would be a straight line, say <i>MB</i>. If, however, the earth exerts attraction, the moon would be pulled inward. Instead
of following the line <i>MB</i> it would follow the curved path <i>MB&#x2032;</i>. And again, the moon having arrived at <i>B&#x2032;</i>, is prevented from following the line <i>B&#x2032;C</i>, but rather <i>B&#x2032;C&#x2032;</i>. So that the path instead of being a straight line tends to become curved. From Kepler&#x2019;s
researches the probabilities were that this curve would assume the shape of an ellipse
rather than a circle.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p009width"><img src="images/p009.png" alt="" width="302" height="245"></div><p>
</p>
<p>The only reason, then, why the moon does not fall to the earth is on account of its
motion. Were it to stop moving even for the fraction of a second it would come straight
down to us, and probably few would live to tell the tale.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>Newton reasoned that what keeps the moon revolving around the earth is the gravitational
pull of the latter. The next important step was to discover the law regulating this
motion. Here Kepler&#x2019;s observations of the movements of the planets around the sun
was of inestimable value; for from these Newton deduced the hypothesis that attraction
varies inversely as the square of the distance. Making use of this hypothesis, Newton
calculated what the attractive power possessed by the earth must be in order that
the moon may continue in its path. He next compared this force with the force exerted
by the earth in pulling the apple to the ground, and found the forces to be identical!
&#x201c;I compared,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;the force necessary to keep the moon in her orb with the
force of gravity at the surface of the earth, and found them answer pretty nearly.&#x201d;
One and the same force pulls the moon and pulls the apple&#x2014;the force of gravity. Further,
the hypothesis that the force of gravity varies inversely as the square of the distance
had now received experimental confirmation.
</p>
<p>The next step was perfectly clear. If the moon&#x2019;s motion is controlled by the earth&#x2019;s
gravitational pull, why is it not possible that the earth&#x2019;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>motion, in turn, is controlled by the sun&#x2019;s gravitational pull? that, in fact, not
only the earth&#x2019;s motion, but the motion of all the planets is regulated by the same
means?
</p>
<p>Here again Kepler&#x2019;s pioneer work was a foundation comparable to reinforced concrete.
Kepler, as we have seen, had shown that the earth revolves around the sun in the form
of an ellipse, one of the foci of this ellipse being occupied by the sun. Newton now
proved that such an elliptic path was possible only if the intensity of the attractive
force between sun and planet varied inversely as the square of the distance&#x2014;the very
same relationship that had been applied with such success in explaining the motion
of the moon around the earth!
</p>
<p>Newton showed that the moon, the sun, the planets&#x2014;every body in space conformed to
this law. The earth attracts the moon; but so does the moon the earth. If the moon
revolves around the earth rather than the earth around the moon, it is because the
earth is a much larger body, and hence its gravitational pull is stronger. The same
is true of the relationship existing between the earth and the sun.
</p>
<p><i>Further Developments of Newton&#x2019;s Law of Gravitation.</i> When we speak of the earth attracting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>the moon, and the moon the earth, what we really mean is that every one of the myriad
particles composing the earth attracts every one of the myriad particles composing
the moon, and vice versa. If in dealing with the attractive forces existing between
a planet and its satellite, or a planet and the sun, the power exerted by every one
of these myriad particles would have to be considered separately, then the mathematical
task of computing such forces might well appear hopeless. Newton was able to present
the problem in a very simple form by pointing out that in a sphere such as the earth
or the moon, the entire mass might be considered as residing in the center of the
sphere. For purposes of computation, the earth can be considered a particle, with
its entire mass concentrated at the center of the particle. This viewpoint enabled
Newton to extend his law of inverse squares to the remotest bodies in the universe.
</p>
<p>If this great law of Newton&#x2019;s found such general application beyond our planet, it
served an equally useful purpose in explaining a number of puzzling features on this
planet. The ebb and flow of the tides was one of these puzzles. Even in ancient times
it had been noticed that a full moon and a high tide went hand in hand, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>various mysterious powers, were attributed to the satellite and the ocean. Newton
pointed out that the height of the water was a direct consequence of the attractive
power of the moon, and, to a lesser extent, because further away, of the sun.
</p>
<p>One of his first explanations, however, dealt with certain irregularities in the moon&#x2019;s
motion around the earth. If the solar system would consist of the earth and moon alone,
then the path of the moon would be that of an ellipse, with one of the foci of this
ellipse occupied by the earth. Unfortunately for the simplicity of the problem, there
are other bodies relatively near in space, particularly that huge body, the sun. The
sun not only exerts its pull on the earth but also on the moon. However, as the sun
is much further away from the moon than is the earth, the earth&#x2019;s attraction for its
satellite is much greater, despite the fact that the sun is much huger and weighs
far more than the earth. The greater pull of the earth in one direction, and a lesser
pull of the sun in another, places the poor moon between the devil and the deep sea.
The situation gives rise to a complexity of forces, the net result of which is that
the moon&#x2019;s orbit is not quite that of an ellipse. Newton was able to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>account for all the forces that come into play, and he proved that the actual path
of the moon was a direct consequence of the law of inverse squares in actual operation.
</p>
<p><i>The &#x201c;Principia.&#x201d;</i> The law of gravitation, embodying also laws of motion, which we shall discuss presently,
was first published in Newton&#x2019;s immortal &#x201c;Principia&#x201d; (1686). A selection from the
preface will disclose the contents of the book, and, incidentally, the style of the
author: &#x201c;&#x2026; We offer this work as mathematical principles of philosophy; for all the
difficulty in philosophy seems to consist in this&#x2014;from the phenomena of motions to
investigate the forces of nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other
phenomena; and to this end the general propositions in the first and second book are
directed. In the third book we give an example of this in the explication of the system
of the world; for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the first book,
we there derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity with which bodies
tend to the sun and the several planets. Then, from these forces, by other propositions
which are also mathematical, we deduce the motions of the planets, the comets, the
moon and the sea. I wish we could derive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical
principles; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend upon
certain forces by which the particles of bodies, by some causes hitherto unknown,
are either mutually impelled towards each other, and cohere in regular figures, or
are repelled and recede from each other.&#x2026;&#x201d;
</p>
<p>At this point we may state that neither Newton, nor any of Newton&#x2019;s successors including
Einstein, have been able to advance even a plausible theory as to the nature of this
gravitational force. We know that this force pulls a stone to the ground; we know,
thanks to Newton, the laws regulating the motions due to gravity; but what this force
we call gravity really is we do not know. The mystery is as deep as the mystery of
the origin of life.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Prof. Einstein,&#x201d; writes Prof. Eddington, &#x201c;has sought, and has not reached, any ultimate
explanation of its [that is, gravitation] cause. A certain connection between the
gravitational field and the measurement of space has been postulated, but this throws
light rather on the nature of our measurements than on gravitation itself. The relativity
theory is indifferent to hypotheses as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>to the nature of gravitation, just as it is indifferent to hypotheses as to the nature
of light.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><i>Newton&#x2019;s Laws of Motion</i>. In his <i>Principia</i> Newton begins with a series of simple definitions dealing with matter and force,
and these are followed by his three famous laws of motion. The nature and amount of
the effort required to start a body moving, and the conditions required to keep a
body in motion, are included in these laws. The Fundamentals, mass, time and space,
are exhibited in their various relationships. Of importance to us particularly is
that in these laws, time and space are considered as definite entities, and as two
distinct and widely separated manifestations. We shall see that in Einstein&#x2019;s hands
a very close relationship between these two is brought about.
</p>
<p>Both Newton and Einstein were led to their theory of gravitation by profound studies
of the mathematics of motion, but as Newton&#x2019;s conception of motion differed from Einstein&#x2019;s,
and as, moreover, important discoveries into the nature of matter and the relationship
of motion to matter were made subsequent to Newton&#x2019;s time, we need not wonder that
the two theories show divergence; that, as we shall see, Newton&#x2019;s is probably but
an approximation of the truth. If we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>confine our attention to our own solar system, the deviation from Newton&#x2019;s law is,
as a rule, so small as to be negligible.
</p>
<p>Newton&#x2019;s laws of motion are really axioms, like the axioms of Euclid: they do not
admit of direct proof; but there is this difference, that the axioms of Euclid seem
more obviously true. For example, when Euclid informs us that &#x201c;things which are equal
to the same thing are equal to one another,&#x201d; we have no hesitation in accepting this
statement, for it seems so self-evident. When, however, we are told by Newton that
&#x201c;the alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed,&#x201d; we
are at first somewhat bewildered with the phraseology, and then, even when that has
been mastered, the readiness with which we respond will probably depend upon the amount
of scientific training we have received.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,
unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.&#x201d; So runs
Newton&#x2019;s first law of motion. A body does not move unless something causes it to move;
to make the body move you must overcome the <i>inertia</i> of the body. On the other hand, if a body is moving, it tends to continue <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>moving, as witness our forward movement when the train is brought to a standstill.
It may be asked, why does not a bullet continue moving indefinitely once it has left
the barrel of the gun? Because of the resistance of the air which it has to overcome;
and the path of the bullet is not straight because gravity acts on it and tends to
pull it downwards.
</p>
<p>We have no definite means of proving that a body once set in motion would continue
moving, for an indefinite time, and along a straight line. What Newton meant was that
a body would continue moving provided no external force acted on it; but in actual
practise such a condition is unknown.
</p>
<p>Newton&#x2019;s first law defines force as that action necessary to change a state of rest
or of uniform motion, and tells us that force alone changes the motion of a body.
His second law deals with the relation of the force applied and the resulting change
of motion of the body; that is, it shows us how force may be measured. &#x201c;The alteration
of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed, and is made in the direction
of the right line in which that force is impressed.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Newton&#x2019;s third law runs&#x2014;&#x201c;To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.&#x201d;
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>very fact that you have to use force means that you have to overcome something of
an opposite nature. The forward pull of a horse towing a boat equals the backward
pull of the tow-rope connecting boat and horse. &#x201c;Many people,&#x201d; says Prof. Watson,
&#x201c;find a difficulty in accepting this statement &#x2026; since they think that if the force
exerted by the horse on the rope were not a little greater than the backward force
exerted by the rope on the horse, the boat would not progress. In this case we must,
however, remember that, as far as their relative positions are concerned, the horse
and the boat are at rest, and form a single body, and the action and reaction between
them, due to the tension on the rope, must be equal and opposite, for otherwise there
would be relative motion, one with respect to the other.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It may well be asked, what bearing have these laws of Newton on the question of time
and space? Simply this, that to measure force the factors necessary are the masses
of the bodies concerned, the time involved and the space covered; and Newton&#x2019;s equations
for measuring forces assume time and space to be quite independent of one another.
As we shall see, this is in striking contrast to Einstein&#x2019;s view.
</p>
<p><i>Newton&#x2019;s Researches on Light</i>. In 1665, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>but 23 years old, Newton invented the binomial theorem and the infinitesimal calculus,
two phases of pure mathematics which have been the cause of many a sleepless night
to college freshmen. Had Newton done nothing else his fame would have been secure.
But we have already glanced at his law of inverse squares and the law of gravitation.
We now have to turn to some of Newton&#x2019;s contributions to optics, because here more
than elsewhere we shall find the starting point to a series of researches which have
culminated so brilliantly in the work of Einstein.
</p>
<p>Newton turned his attention to optics in 1666 when he proved that the light from the
sun, which appears white to us, is in reality a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow.
This he showed by placing a prism between the ray of light and a screen. A spectrum
showing all the colors from red to violet appeared on the screen.
</p>
<p>Another notable achievement of his was the design of a telescope which brought objects
to a sharp focus and prevented the blurring effects which had occasioned so much annoyance
to Newton and his predecessors in all their astronomical observations.
</p>
<p>These and other discoveries of very great interest were brought together in a volume
on optics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>which Newton published in 1704. Our particular concern here is to examine the views
advanced by him as to the nature of light.
</p>
<p>That the nature of light should have been a subject for speculation even to the ancients
need not surprise us. If other senses, as touch, for example, convey impressions of
objects, it is true to say that the sense of sight conveys the most complete impression.
Our conception of the external world is largely based upon the sense of sight; particularly
so when we deal with objects beyond our reach. In astronomy, therefore, a study of
the properties of light is indispensable.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e446src" href="#xd29e446">1</a>
</p>
<p>But what is this light? We open our eyes and we see; we close our eyes and we fail
to see. At night in a dark room we may have our eyes open and yet we do not see; light,
then, must be absent. Evidently, light does not wholly depend upon whether our eyes
are open or closed. This much is certain: the eye functions and something else functions.
What is this &#x201c;something else&#x201d;?
</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Plato and Aristotle regarded light as a property of the eye and
the eye <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>alone. Out of the eye tentacles were shot which intercepted the object and so illuminated
it. From what has already been said, such a view seems highly unlikely. Far more consistent
with their philosophy in other directions would have been the theory that light has
its source in the object and not in the eye, and travels from object to eye rather
than the reverse. How little substance the Aristotelian contribution possesses is
immediately seen when we refer to the art of photography. Here light rays produce
effects which are independent of any property of the eye. The blind man may click
the camera and produce the impression on the plate.
</p>
<p>Newton, of course, could have fallen into no such error as did Plato and Aristotle.
The source of light to him was the luminous body. Such a body had the power of emitting
minute particles at great speed, and these when coming in contact with the retina
produce the sensation of sight.
</p>
<p>This emission or corpuscular theory of Newton&#x2019;s was combated very strongly by his
illustrious Dutch contemporary, Huyghens, who maintained that light was a wave phenomenon,
the disturbance starting at the luminous body and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>spreading out in all directions. The wave motions of the sea offer a certain analogy.
</p>
<p>Newton&#x2019;s strongest objection to Huyghens&#x2019; wave theory was that it seemed to offer
no satisfactory explanation as to why light travelled in straight lines. He says:
&#x201c;To me the fundamental supposition itself seems impossible, namely that the waves
or vibrations of any fluid can, like the rays of light, be propagated in straight
lines, without a continual and very extravagant bending and spreading every way into
the quiescent medium, where they are terminated by it. I mistake if there be not both
experiment and demonstration to the contrary.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>In the corpuscular theory the particles emitted by the luminous body were supposed
to travel in straight lines. In empty space the particles travelled in straight lines
and spread in all directions. To explain how light could traverse some types of matter&#x2014;liquids,
for example&#x2014;Newton supposed that these light particles travelled in the spaces between
the molecules of the liquid.
</p>
<p>Newton&#x2019;s objection to the wave theory was not answered very convincingly by Huyghens.
Today we know that light waves of high frequency tend to travel in straight lines,
but may be prevented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>from doing so by gravitational forces of bodies near its path. But this is Einstein&#x2019;s
discovery.
</p>
<p>A very famous experiment by Foucault in 1853 proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that
Newton&#x2019;s corpuscular theory was untenable. According to Newton&#x2019;s theory, the velocity
of light must be greater in a denser medium (such as water) than in a lighter one
(such as air). According to the wave theory the reverse is true. Foucault showed that
light does travel more slowly in water than in air. The facts were against Newton
and in favor of Huyghens; and where facts and theory clash there is but one thing
to do: discard the theory.
</p>
<p><i>Some Facts about Newton.</i> Newton was a Cambridge man, and Newton made Cambridge famous as a mathematical center.
Since Newton&#x2019;s day Cambridge has boasted of a Clerk Maxwell and a Rayleigh, and her
Larmor, her J.&nbsp;J. Thomson and her Rutherford are still with us. Newton entered Trinity
College when he was 18 and soon threw himself into higher mathematics. In 1669, when
but 27 years old, he became professor of mathematics at Cambridge, and later represented
that seat of learning in Parliament. When his friend Montague became Chancellor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>of the Exchequer, Newton was offered, and accepted, the lucrative position of Master
of the Mint. As president of the Royal Society Newton was occasionally brought in
contact with Queen Anne. She held Newton in high esteem, and in 1705 she conferred
the honor of knighthood on him. He died in 1727.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I do not know,&#x201d; wrote Newton, &#x201c;what I may appear to the world, but, to myself, I
seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and directing myself in
now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the
great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Such was the modesty of one whom many regard as the greatest intellect of all ages.

<h2 class="main">THE ETHER AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd29e494"><span class="xd29e494init">H</span>uyghens&#x2019; wave theory of light, now so generally accepted, loses its entire significance
if a medium for the propagation of these waves is left out of consideration. This
medium we call the ether.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e496src" href="#xd29e496">1</a>
</p>
<p>Huyghens&#x2019; reasoning may be illustrated in some such way as this: If a body moves a
force pushes or pulls it. That force itself is exemplified in some kind of matter&#x2014;say
a horse. The horse in pulling a cart is attached to the cart. The horse in pulling
a boat may not be attached to the boat directly but to a rope, which in turn is attached
to the boat. In common cases where one piece of matter affects another, there is some
direct contact, some go-between.
</p>
<p>But cases are known where matter affects matter without affording us any evidence
of contact. Take the case of a magnet&#x2019;s attraction for a piece of iron. Where is the
rope that pulls the iron towards the magnet? Perhaps you think the attraction due
to the air in between the magnet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>and iron? But removing the air does not stop the attraction. Yet how can we conceive
of the iron being drawn to the magnet unless there is some go-between? some medium
not readily perceptible to the senses perhaps, and therefore not strictly a form of
matter?
</p>
<p>If we can but picture some such medium we can imagine our magnet giving rise to vibrations
in this medium which are carried to the iron. The magnet may give rise to a disturbance
in that portion of the medium nearest to it; then this portion hands over the disturbance
to its neighbor, the next portion of the medium; and so on, until the disturbance
reaches the iron. You see, we are satisfying our sense-perception by arguing in favor
of action by actual contact rather than some vague action at a distance; the go-between
instead of being a rope is the medium called the ether.
</p>
<p>Foucault&#x2019;s experiment completely shattered the corpuscular theory of light, and for
want of any other more plausible alternative, we are thrown back on Huyghens&#x2019; wave
theory. It will presently appear that this wave theory has elements in it which make
it an excellent alternative. In the meantime, if light is to be considered as a wave
motion, then the query immediately arises, what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>is the medium through which these waves are propagated? If water is the medium for
the waves of the sea, what is the medium for the waves of light? Again we answer,
the medium is the ether.
</p>
<p><i>What Is This &#x201c;Ether&#x201d;?</i> Balloonists find conditions more and more uncomfortable the higher they ascend, for
the density of the air (and therefore the amount of oxygen in a given volume of air)
becomes less and less. Meteorologists have calculated that traces of the air we breathe
may reach a height of some 200 miles. But what is beyond? Nothing but the ether, it
is claimed. Light from the sun and stars reaches us via the ether.
</p>
<p>But what is this ether? We cannot handle it. We cannot see it. It fails to fall within
the scope of any of our senses, for every attempt to show its presence has failed.
It is spirit-like in the popular sense. It is Lodge&#x2019;s medium for the souls of the
departed.
</p>
<p>Helmholtz and Kelvin tried to arrive at some properties of this hypothetical substance
from a careful study of the manner in which waves were propagated through this ether.
If, as the wave theory teaches us, the ether can be set in motion, then according
to laws of mechanics, the ether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>has mass. If so it is smaller in amount than anything which can be detected with our
most accurate balance. Further&#x2014;and this is a difficulty not easily explained&#x2014;if this
ether has any mass, why does it offer no detectable resistance to the velocity of
the planets in it? Why is not the velocity of the planets reduced in time, just as
the velocity of a rifle bullet decreases owing to the resistance of the air?
</p>
<p>Lodge, in arguing in favor of an ether, holds that its presence cannot be detected
because it pervades all space and all matter. His favorite analogy is to point out
the extreme unlikelihood of a deep-sea fish discovering the presence of the water
with which it is surrounded on all sides;&#x2014;all of which tells us nothing about the
ether, but does try to tell us why we cannot detect it.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e522src" href="#xd29e522">2</a>
</p>
<p>In short, answering the query at the head of this paragraph, we may say that we do
not know.
</p>
<p><i>Waves Set up in This Ether.</i> The waves are not all of the same length. Those that produce the sensation of sight
are not the smallest waves known, yet their length is so small that it would take
anywhere from one to two million of them to cover a yard. Curiously enough, our eye
is not sensitive to wave lengths beyond either side of these limits; yet much smaller,
and much larger <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>waves are known. The smallest are the famous X-rays, which are scarcely one ten-thousandth
the size of light waves. Waves which have a powerful chemical action&#x2014;those which act
on a photographic plate, for example&#x2014;are longer than X-rays, yet smaller than light
waves. Waves larger than light waves are those which produce the sensation of heat,
and those used in wireless telegraphy. The latter may reach the enormous length of
5,000 yards. X-ray, actinic, or chemically active ray, light ray, heat ray, wireless
ray&#x2014;they differ in size, yet they all have this in common: they travel with the same
speed (186,000 miles per second).
</p>
<p><i>The Electromagnetic Theory of Light.</i> Powerful support to the conception that space is pervaded by ether was given when
Maxwell discovered light to be an <span class="corr" id="xd29e538" title="Source: electro-magnetic">electromagnetic</span> phenomenon. From purely theoretical considerations this gifted English physicist
was led to the view that waves could be set up as a result of electrical disturbances.
He proved that such waves would travel with the same velocity as light waves. As air
is not needed to transmit electrical phenomena&#x2014;for you can pump all air out of a system
and produce a vacuum, and electrical phenomena will continue&#x2014;Maxwell was forced to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>the conclusion that the waves set up by electrical disturbances and transmitted with
the same velocity as light, were enabled to do so with the help of the same medium
as light, namely, the ether.
</p>
<p>It was now but a step for Maxwell to formulate the theory that light itself is nothing
but an electrical phenomenon, the sensation of light being due to the passage of electric
waves through the ether. This theory met with considerable opposition at first. Physicists
had been brought up in a school which had taught that light and electricity were two
entirely unrelated phenomena, and it was difficult for them to loosen the shackles
that bound them to the older school. But two startling discoveries helped to fasten
attention upon Maxwell&#x2019;s theory. One was an experimental confirmation of Maxwell&#x2019;s
theoretical deduction. Hertz, a pupil of Helmholtz, showed how the discharge from
a Leyden jar set up oscillations, which in turn gave rise to waves in the ether, comparable,
in so far as velocity is concerned, to light waves, but differing from the latter
in wave length, the Hertzian waves being much longer. At a later date these waves
were further investigated by Marconi, with the result that wireless messages soon
began to be flashed from one place to another.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>Just as there is a close connection between light and electricity, so there is between
light and magnetism. The first to point out such a relationship was the illustrious
Michael Faraday, but we owe to Zeeman the most extensive investigations in this field.
</p>
<p>If we throw some common salt into a flame, and, with the help of a spectroscope, examine
the spectrum produced, we are struck by two bright lines which stand out very prominently.
These lines, yellow in color, are known as the D-lines and serve to identify even
minute traces of sodium. What is true of sodium is true of other elements: they all
produce very characteristic spectra. Now Zeeman found that if the flame is placed
between a powerful magnet, and then some common salt thrown into the flame, the two
yellow lines give place to ten yellow lines. Such is one of the results of the effect
of a magnetic field on light.
</p>
<p><i>The Electron.</i> The &#x201c;Zeeman effect&#x201d; led to several theories regarding its nature. The most successful
of these was one proposed by Larmor and more fully treated by Lorentz. It has already
been pointed out that the only difference between wireless and light waves is that
the former are much &#x201c;longer,&#x201d; and, we may now add, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>their vibrations are much slower. Light and wireless waves bear a relationship to
one another comparable to the relationship born by high and low-pitched sounds. To
produce wireless waves we allow a charge of electricity to oscillate to and fro. These
oscillations, or oscillating charges, are the cause of such waves. What charges give
rise to light waves? Lorentz, from a study of the Zeeman effect, ascribed them to
minute particles of matter, smaller than the chemical atom, to which the name &#x201c;electron&#x201d;
was given.
</p>
<p>The unit of electricity is the electron. Electrons in motion give rise to electricity,
and electrons in vibration, to light. The Zeeman effect gave Lorentz enough data to
calculate the mass of such electrons. He then showed that these electrons in a magnetic
field would be disturbed by precisely the amount to which Zeeman&#x2019;s observations pointed.
In other words, the assumption of the electron fitted in most admirably with Zeeman&#x2019;s
experiments on magnetism and light.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, a study of the discharge of electricity through gases, and, later,
the discovery of radium, led, among other things, to a study of beta or cathode rays&#x2014;negatively
charged particles of electricity. Through a series of strikingly original experiments
J.&nbsp;J. Thomson ascertained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>the mass of such particles or corpuscles, and then the very striking fact was brought
out that Thomson&#x2019;s corpuscle weighed the same as Lorentz&#x2019;s electron. The electron
was not merely the unit of electricity but the smallest particle of matter.
</p>
<p><i>The Nature of Matter.</i> All matter is made up of some eighty-odd elements. Oxygen, copper, lead are examples
of such elements. Each element in turn consists of an innumerable number of atoms,
of a size so small, that 300 million of them could be placed alongside of one another
without their total length exceeding one inch.
</p>
<p>John Dalton more than a hundred years ago postulated a theory, now known as the atomic
theory, to explain one of the fundamental laws in chemistry. This theory started out
with an old Greek assumption that matter cannot be divided indefinitely, but that,
by continued subdivision, a point would be reached beyond which no further breaking
up would be possible. The particles at this stage Dalton called atoms.
</p>
<p>Dalton&#x2019;s atomic hypothesis became one of the pillars upon which the whole superstructure
of chemistry rested, and this because it explained a number of perplexing difficulties
so much more satisfactorily than any other hypothesis.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>For nearly a century Dalton stood as firm as a rock. But early in the nineties some
epoch-making experiments on the discharge of electricity through gases were begun
by a group of physicists, particularly Crookes, Rutherford, Lenard, Roentgen, Becquerel,
and, above all, J.&nbsp;J. Thomson, which pointed very clearly to the fact that the atoms
are not the smallest particles of matter at all; that, in fact, they could be broken
up into electrons, of a diameter one one-hundred-thousandth that of an atom.
</p>
<p>It remained for the illustrious Madame Curie to confirm this beyond all doubt by her
isolation of radium. Here, as Madame Curie showed, was an element whose atoms were
actually breaking up under one&#x2019;s very eyes, so to speak.
</p>
<p>So far have we advanced since Dalton&#x2019;s day, that Dalton&#x2019;s unit, the atom, is now pictured
as a complex particle patterned after our solar system, with a nucleus of positive
electricity in the center, and particles of negative electricity, or electrons, surrounding
the nucleus.
</p>
<p>All this leads to one inevitable conclusion: matter is electrical in nature. But now
if matter and light have the same origin, and matter is subject to gravitation, why
not light also? So reasoned Einstein.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Summary.</i> Newton&#x2019;s studies of matter in motion led to his theory of gravitation, and, incidentally,
to his conception of time and space as definite entities. As we shall see, Einstein
in his theory of gravitation based it upon discoveries belonging to the post-Newtonian
period. One of these is Minkowski&#x2019;s theory of time and space as one and inseparable.
This theory we shall discuss at some length in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>Other important discoveries which led up to Einstein&#x2019;s work are the researches which
culminated in the electron theory of matter. The origin of this theory may be traced
to studies dealing with the nature of light.
</p>
<p>Here again Newton appears as a pioneer. Newton&#x2019;s corpuscular theory, however, proved
wholly untenable when Foucault showed that the velocity of light in water is less
than in air, which is the very reverse of what the corpuscular theory demands, but
which does agree with Huyghens&#x2019; wave theory.
</p>
<p>But Huyghens&#x2019; wave theory postulated some medium in which the waves can act. To this
medium the name &#x201c;ether&#x201d; was given. However, all attempts to show the presence of such
an ether failed. Naturally enough, some began to doubt the existence of an ether altogether.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>Huyghens&#x2019; wave theory received a new lease of life with Maxwell&#x2019;s discovery that light
is an electromagnetic phenomenon; that the waves set up by a source of light were
comparable to waves set up by an electrical disturbance.
</p>
<p>Zeeman next showed that magnetism was also, closely related to light.
</p>
<p>A study of Zeeman&#x2019;s experiments led Lorentz to the conclusion that electrical phenomena
are due to the motion of charged particles called &#x201c;electrons,&#x201d; and that the vibrations
of these electrons give rise to light.
</p>
<p>The conception of the electron as the very fundamental of matter was arrived at in
an entirely different way: from studies dealing with the discharge of electricity
through gases and the breaking up of the atoms of radium.
</p>
<p>If matter and light have the same origin, and if matter is subject to gravitation,
why not light also?

<p class="xd29e615"><span class="xd29e615init">&#x201c;T</span>his is the most important result obtained in connection with the theory of gravitation
since Newton&#x2019;s day. Einstein&#x2019;s reasoning is the result of one of the highest achievements
of human thought.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>These words were uttered by Sir J.&nbsp;J. Thomson, the president of the Royal Society,
at a meeting of that body held on November 6, 1919, to discuss the results of the
Eclipse Expedition.
</p>
<p>Einstein another Newton&#x2014;and this from the lips of J.&nbsp;J. Thomson, England&#x2019;s most illustrious
physicist! If ever man weighed words carefully it is this Cambridge professor, whose
own researches have assured him immortality for all time.
</p>
<p>What has this Albert Einstein done to merit such extraordinary praise? With the world
in turmoil, with classes and races in a death struggle, with millions suffering and
starving, why do we find time to turn our attention to this Jew? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>His ideas have no bearing on Europe&#x2019;s calamity. They will not add one bushel of wheat
to starving populations.
</p>
<p>The answer is not hard to find. Men come and men go, but the mystery of the universe
remains. It is Einstein&#x2019;s glory to have given us a deeper insight into the universe.
Our scientists are Huxley&#x2019;s agnostics: they do not deny activities beyond our planet;
they merely center their attention on the knowable on this earth. Our philosophers,
on the other hand, go far afield. Some of them soar so high that, like one poet&#x2019;s
opinion of Shelley, the bubble bursts. Einstein, using the tools of the scientist&#x2014;the
experimentalist&#x2014;builded a skyscraper which ultimately reached the philosophical school.
His rôle is the rôle of alcohol in causing water and ether (the anæsthetic) to mix.
Ether and water will mix no better than oil and water, without the presence of alcohol;
in its presence a uniform mixture is obtained.
</p>
<p><i>The Object of the Eclipse Expedition.</i> Einstein prophesied that a ray of light passing near the sun would be pulled out
of its course, due to the action of gravity. He went even further. He predicted how
much out of its course the ray would be deflected. This prediction was based <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>on a theory of gravitation which Einstein had developed in great mathematical detail.
The object of the British Eclipse Expedition was either to prove or disprove Einstein&#x2019;s
assumption.
</p>
<p><i>The Result of the Expedition.</i> Einstein&#x2019;s prophecy was fulfilled almost to the letter.
</p>
<p><i>The Significance of the Result.</i> Since Einstein&#x2019;s theory of gravitation is intimately associated with certain revolutionary
ideas concerning time and space, and, therefore, with Fundamentals of the Universe,
the net result of the expedition was to strengthen our belief in the validity of his
new view of the universe.
</p>
<p>It is our intention in the following pages to discuss the expedition and the larger
aspects of Einstein&#x2019;s theory that follow from it. But before we do so we must have
a clear idea of our solar system.
</p>
<p><i>Our Solar System.</i> In the center of our system is the sun, a flaming mass of fire, much bigger than
our own earth, and very, very far away. The sun has its family of eight planets&#x2014;of
which the earth is one&#x2014;which travel around the sun; and around some of the planets
there travel satellites, or moons. The earth has such a satellite, <i>the</i> moon.
</p>
<p>Now we have good reasons for believing that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>every star which twinkles in the sky is a sun comparable to our own, having also its
own planets and its own moons. These stars, or suns, are so much further away from
us than our own sun, that but a speck of their light reaches us, and then only at
night, when, as the poets would say, our sun has gone to its resting place.
</p>
<p>The distances between bodies in the solar system is so immense that, like the number
of dollars spent in the Great War, the number of miles conveys little, or no impression.
But picture yourself in an express train going at the average rate of 30 miles an
hour. If you start from New York and travel continuously you would reach San Francisco
in 4 days. If you could continue your journey around the earth at the same rate you
would complete it in 35 days. If now you could travel <i>into</i> space and <i>to</i> the moon, still with the same velocity, you would reach it in 350 days. Having reached
the moon, you could circumscribe it with the same express train in 8 days, as compared
to the 35 days it would take you to circumscribe the earth. If instead of travelling
to the moon you would book your passage for the sun you, or rather your descendants,
would get there in 350 <i>years</i>, and it would then take them 10 additional years to travel around the sun.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>Immense as these distances are, they are small as compared to the distances that separate
us from the stars. It takes light which, instead of travelling 30 miles an hour, travels
186,000 miles a <i>second</i>, about 8 minutes to get to us from the sun, and a little over 4 years to reach us
from the nearest star. The light from some of the other stars do not reach us for
several hundred years.
</p>
<p><i>The Eclipse of the Sun.</i> Now to return to an infinitesimal part of the universe&#x2014;our solar system. We have
seen that the earth travels around the sun, and the moon around the earth. At some
time in the course of these revolutions the moon must come directly between the earth
and the sun. Then we get the <i>eclipse</i> of the sun. As the moon is smaller than the earth, only a portion of the earth&#x2019;s
surface will be cut off from the sun&#x2019;s rays. That portion which is so cut off suffers
a total eclipse. This explains why the eclipse of May, 1919, which was a total one
for Brazil, was but a partial one for us.
</p>
<p><i>Einstein&#x2019;s Assertion Re-stated.</i> Einstein claimed that a ray of light from one of the stars, if passing near enough
to the surface of the sun, would be appreciably deflected from its course; and he
calculated the exact amount of this deflection. To begin with, why should Einstein
suppose that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>the path of a ray of light would be affected by the son?
</p>
<p>Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation made it clear that bodies which have mass attract one
another. If light has mass&#x2014;and very recent work tends to show that it has&#x2014;there is
no reason why light should not be attracted by the sun, or any other planetary body.
The question that agitated scientists was not so much whether a ray of light would
be deviated from its path, but to what extent this deviation would take place. Would
Einstein&#x2019;s figures be confirmed?
</p>
<p>Of the bodies within our solar system the sun is by far the largest, and therefore
it would exert a far greater pull than any of the planets on light rays coming from
the stars. Under ordinary conditions, however, the sun itself shines with such brilliancy,
that objects around it, including rays of light passing near its surface, are wholly
dimmed. Hence the necessity of putting our theory to the test only when the moon covers
up the sun&#x2014;when there is a total eclipse of the sun.
</p>
<p><i>A Graphical Representation.</i> Imagine a star <i>A</i>, so selected that as its light comes to us the ray just grazes the sun. If the path
of the ray is straight&#x2014;if the sun has no influence on it&#x2014;then the path can be represented
by the line <i>AB</i>. If, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>however, the sun does exert a gravitational pull, then its real path will be <i>AB&#x2032;</i>, and to an observer on the earth the star will have appeared to shift from <i>A</i> to <i>A&#x2032;</i>.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p047width"><img src="images/p047.png" alt="" width="455" height="115"></div><p>
</p>
<p><i>What the Eclipse Expedition Set Out to Do.</i> Photographs of stars around the sun were to be taken during the eclipse, and these
photographs compared with others of the same region taken at night, with the sun absent.
Any apparent shifting of the stars could be determined by measuring the distances
between the stars as shown on the photographic plates.
</p>
<p><i>Three Possibilities Anticipated.</i> According to Newton&#x2019;s assumption, light consists of corpuscles, or minute particles,
emitted from the source of light. If this be true these particles, having mass, should
be affected by the gravitational pull of the sun. If we apply Newton&#x2019;s theory of gravitation
and make use of his formula, it can be shown that such a gravitational pull would
displace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>the ray of light by an average amount equal to 0.75 (seconds of angular distance.)<a class="noteref" id="xd29e699src" href="#xd29e699">1</a> On the other hand, where light is regarded as waves set in motion in the &#x201c;ether&#x201d;
of space (the wave theory of light), and where weight is denied light altogether,
no deviation need be expected. Finally there is a third alternative: Einstein&#x2019;s. Light,
says Einstein, has mass, and therefore probably weight. Mass is the matter light contains;
weight represents pull by gravity. Light rays will be attracted by the sun, but according
to Einstein&#x2019;s theory of gravitation the sun&#x2019;s gravitational pull will displace the
rays by an average amount equal to 1.75 (seconds of angular distance).
</p>
<p><i>The Expeditions.</i> That science is highly international, despite many recent examples to the contrary,
is evidenced by this British Eclipse Expedition. Here was a theory propounded by one
who had accepted a chair of physics in the university of Berlin, and across the English
Channel were Germany&#x2019;s mortal enemies making elaborate preparations to test the validity
of the Berlin professor&#x2019;s theory.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>The British Astronomical Society began to plan the eclipse expedition even before
the outbreak of the Great War. During the years that followed, despite the destinies
of nations which hung on threads from day to day, despite the darkest hours in the
history of the British people, our English astronomers continued to give attention
to the details of the proposed expedition. When the day of the eclipse came all was
in readiness.
</p>
<p>One expedition under Dr. Crommelin was sent to Sobral, Brazil; another, under Prof.
Eddington, to Principe, an island off the west coast of Africa. In both these places
a total eclipse was anticipated.
</p>
<p>The eclipse occurred on May 29, 1919. It lasted for six to eight minutes. Some 15
photographs, with an average exposure of five to six seconds, were taken. Two months
later another series of photographs of the same region were taken, but this time the
sun was no longer in the midst of these stars.
</p>
<p>The photographs were brought to the famous Greenwich Observatory, near London, and
the astronomers and mathematicians began their laborious measurements and calculations.
</p>
<p>On November 6, at the meeting of the Royal Society, the result was announced. The
Sobral <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>expedition reported 1.98; the Principe expedition 1.62. The average was 1.8. Einstein
had predicted 1.75, Newton might have predicted 0.75, and the orthodox scientists
would have predicted 0. There could now no longer be any question as to which of the
three theories rested on a sure foundation. To quote Sir Frank Dyson, the Astronomer
Royal: &#x201c;After a careful study of the plates I am prepared to say that there can be
no doubt that they confirm Einstein&#x2019;s prediction. A very definite result has been
obtained that light is deflected in accordance with Einstein&#x2019;s law of gravitation.&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e714src" href="#xd29e714">2</a>
</p>
<p><i>Where Did Einstein Get His Idea of Gravitation?</i> In 1905 Einstein published the first of a series of papers supporting and extending
a theory of time and space to which the name &#x201c;the theory of relativity&#x201d; had been given.
These views as expounded by Einstein came into direct conflict with Newton&#x2019;s ideas
of time and space, and also with Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation. Since Einstein had more
faith in his theory of relativity than in Newton&#x2019;s theory of gravitation, Einstein
so changed the latter as to make it harmonize with the former. More will be said on
this subject.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let not the reader misunderstand. Newton was not wholly in the wrong; he was only
approximately right. With the knowledge existing in Newton&#x2019;s day Newton could have
done no more than he did; no mortal could have done more. But since Newton&#x2019;s day physics&#x2014;and
science in general&#x2014;has advanced in great strides, and Einstein can interpret present-day
knowledge in the same masterful fashion that Newton could in his day. With more facts
to build upon, Einstein&#x2019;s law of gravitation is more universal than Newton&#x2019;s; it really
includes Newton&#x2019;s.
</p>
<p>But now we must turn our attention very briefly to the theory of relativity&#x2014;the theory
that led up to Einstein&#x2019;s law of gravitation.
</p>
<p><i>The Theory of Relativity.</i> The story goes that Einstein was led to his ideas by watching a man fall from a roof.
This story bears a striking similarity to Newton and the apple. Perhaps one is as
true as the other.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e730src" href="#xd29e730">3</a>
</p>
<p>However that may be, the principle of relativity is as old as philosophical thought,
for it denies the possibility of measuring absolute time, or absolute space. All things
are relative. We say that it takes a &#x201c;long time&#x201d; to get from New York to Albany; long
as compared to what? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>long, perhaps, as compared to the time it takes to go from New York City to Brooklyn.
We say the White House is &#x201c;large&#x201d;; large when compared to a room in an apartment.
But we can just as well reverse our ideas of time and distance. The time it takes
to go from New York to Albany is &#x201c;short&#x201d; when compared to the time it takes to go
from New York to San Francisco. The size of the White House is &#x201c;small&#x201d; when compared
to the size of the city of Washington.
</p>
<p>Let us take another illustration. Every time the earth turns on its axis we mark down
as a day. With this as a basis, we say that it takes a little over 365 days for the
earth to complete its revolution around the sun, and our 365 days we call a year.
But now consider some of our other planets. With our time as a basis, it takes Jupiter
or Saturn 10 hours to turn on its axis, as compared to the 24 hours it takes the earth
to turn. Saturn&#x2019;s day is less than one-half our day, and our day is more than twice
Saturn&#x2019;s&#x2014;that is, according to the calculations of the inhabitants of the earth. Mercury
completes her circuit around the sun in 88 days; Neptune, in 164 years. Mercury&#x2019;s
year is but one-fourth ours, Neptune&#x2019;s, 164 times ours. And observers at Mercury and
Neptune would regard us from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53">53</a>]</span><i>their</i> standard of time, which differs from our standard.
</p>
<p>You may say, why not take <i>our</i> standard of time as <i>the</i> standard, and measure everything by it? But why should you? Such a selection would
be quite arbitrary. It would not be based on anything absolute, but would merely depend
on our velocity around the sun.
</p>
<p>These ideas are old enough in metaphysics. Einstein&#x2019;s improvement of them consists
not merely in speculating about them, but in giving them mathematical form.
</p>
<p><i>The Origin of the Theory of Relativity.</i> A train moves with reference to the earth. The earth moves with reference to the
sun. We say the sun is stationary and the earth moves around the sun. But how do we
know that the sun itself does not move with reference to some other body? How do we
know that our planetary system, and the stars, and the cosmos as a whole is not in
motion?
</p>
<p>There is no way of answering such a question unless we could get a point of reference
which is fixed&#x2014;fixed absolutely in space.
</p>
<p>We have already alluded to our view of the nature of light, known as the wave theory
of light. This theory postulates the existence of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>an all-pervading &#x201c;ether&#x201d; in space. Light sets up wave disturbances in this ether,
and is thus propagated. If the ocean were the ether, the waves of the ocean would
compare with the waves set up by the ether.
</p>
<p>But what is this ether? It cannot be seen. It defies weight. It permeates all space.
It permeates all matter. So say the exponents of this ether. To the layman this sounds
very much like another name for the Deity. To Sir Oliver Lodge it represents the spirits
of the departed.
</p>
<p>To us, of importance is the conception that this ether is absolutely stationary. Such
a conception is logical if the various developments in optics and electricity are
considered. But if absolutely stationary, then the ether is the long-sought-for point
of reference, the guide to determine the motion of all bodies in the universe.
</p>
<p><i>The Famous Experiment Performed by Prof. Michelson.</i> If there is an ether, and a stationary ether, and if the earth moves with reference
to this ether, the earth, in moving, must set up ether &#x201c;currents&#x201d;&#x2014;just as when a train
moves it sets up air currents. So reasoned Michelson, a young Annapolis graduate at
the time. And forthwith he devised a crucial experiment the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>explanation of which we can simplify by the following analogy:
</p>
<p>Which is the quicker, to swim up stream a certain length, say a hundred yards, and
back again, or across stream the same length and back again? The swimmer will answer
that the up-and-down journey is longer.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e770src" href="#xd29e770">4</a>
</p>
<p>Our river is the ether. The earth, if moving in this ether, will set up an ether stream,
the up stream being parallel to the earth&#x2019;s motion. Now suppose we send a beam of
light a certain distance up this ether stream and back, and note the time; and then
turn the beam of light at right angles and send it an equal distance across the stream
and back, and note the time. How will the time taken for light to travel in these
two directions compare? Reasoning by analogy, the up-and-down stream should take longer.
</p>
<p>Michelson&#x2019;s results did not accord with analogy. No difference in time could be detected
between the beam of light travelling up-and-down, and across-and-back.
</p>
<p>But this was contrary to all reason if the postulate of an ether was sound. Must we
then revise our ideas of an ether? Perhaps after all there is no ether.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>But if no ether, how are we to explain the propagation of light in space, and various
electrical phenomena connected with it, such as the Hertzian, or wireless waves?
</p>
<p>There was another alternative, one suggested by Larmor in England and Lorentz in Holland,&#x2014;that
matter is contracted in the direction of its motion through the ether current. To
say that bodies are actually shortened in the direction of their motion&#x2014;by an amount
which increases as the velocity of these bodies approaches that of light&#x2014;is so revolutionary
an idea that Larmor and Lorentz would hardly have adopted such a viewpoint but for
the fact that recent investigations into the nature of matter gave basis for such
belief.
</p>
<p>Matter, it has been shown, is electrical in nature. The forces which hold the particles
together are electrical. Lorentz showed that mathematical formulas for electrical
forces could be developed which would inevitably lead to the view that material bodies
contract in the direction of their motion.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e785src" href="#xd29e785">5</a>
</p>
<p>&#x201c;But this is ridiculous,&#x201d; you say; &#x201c;if I am shorter in one direction than in another
I would notice it.&#x201d; You would if some things were shortened and others were not. But
if all things <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>pointing in a certain direction are shortened to an equal extent, how are you going
to notice it? Will you apply the yard stick? That has been shortened. Will you pass
judgment with the help of your eyes? But your retina has also contracted. In brief,
if all things contract to the same amount it is as if there were no contraction at
all.
</p>
<p><i>Lorentz&#x2019;s Plausible Explanation Really Deepens the Mystery.</i> The startling ideas just outlined have opened up several new vistas, but they have
left unanswered the two problems we set out to solve: whether there is an ether, and
if so, what is the velocity of the earth in reference to this ether? Lorentz maintains
that there is an ether, but the velocities of bodies relative to it must forever remain
a mystery. As you change your position your distances change; you change; everything
about you changes accordingly; and all basis for comparison is lost. Nature has entered
into a conspiracy to keep you ignorant.
</p>
<p><i>Einstein Comes upon the Scene.</i> Einstein starts with the assumption that there is no possible way of identifying
this ether. Suppose we ignore the ether altogether, what then?<a class="noteref" id="xd29e801src" href="#xd29e801">6</a>
</p>
<p>If we do ignore the ether we no longer have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>any absolute point of reference; for if the ether is considered stationary the velocity
of all bodies within the ether may be referred to it; any point in space may be considered
a fixed point. If, however, there is no ether, or if we are to ignore it, how are
we to get the velocity of bodies in space?
</p>
<p><i>The Principle of Relativity.</i> If we are to believe in the &#x201c;causal relationship between only such things as lie
within the realm of observation,&#x201d; then <i>observation</i> teaches us that bodies move only <i>relative</i> to one another, and that the idea of <i>absolute</i> motion of a body in space is meaningless. Einstein, therefore, postulates that there
is no such thing as absolute motion, and that all we can discuss is the relative motion
of one body with respect to another. This is just as logical a deduction from Michelson&#x2019;s
experiment as the attempt to explain Michelson&#x2019;s anomalous results in the light of
an all-pervading ether.
</p>
<p>Consider for a moment Newton&#x2019;s scheme. This great pioneer pictured an absolute standard
of position in space relative to which all velocities are measured. Velocities were
measured by noting the distance covered and dividing the result by the time taken
to cover the distance. Space was a definite entity; and so was time. &#x201c;Time,&#x201d; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>said Newton, &#x201c;flows evenly on,&#x201d; independent of aught else. To Newton time and space
were entirely different, in no way to be confounded.
</p>
<p>Just as Newton conceived of absolute space, so he conceived of absolute time. From
the latter standard of reference the idea of a &#x201c;simultaneity of events&#x201d; at different
places arose. But now if there is no standard of reference, if the ether does not
exist or does not function, if two points <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> cannot be referred to a third, and fixed point <i>C</i>, how can we talk of &#x201c;simultaneity of events&#x201d; at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>?<a class="noteref" id="xd29e838src" href="#xd29e838">7</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p059width"><img src="images/p059.png" alt="" width="401" height="120"></div><p>
</p>
<p>In fact, Einstein shows that if all you can speak about is relative motion, then one
event which takes say one minute on one planet would not take one minute on another.
For consider two bodies in space, say the planets Venus and the earth, with an observer
<i>B</i> on Venus and another <i>A</i> on the earth. <i>B</i> notes the time taken for a ray of light to travel from <i>B</i> to the distance <i>M</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span><i>A</i> on the earth has means of observing the same event. <i>B</i> records one minute. <i>A</i> is puzzled, for his watch records a little more than one minute. What is the explanation?
Granting that the two clocks register the same time to start with, and assuming further
Einstein&#x2019;s hypothesis that the velocity of light is independent of its source, the
difference in time is due to the fact that the planet Venus moves with reference to
the observer on the earth; so that <i>A</i> in reality does not measure the path <i>BM</i> and <i>MB</i>, but <i>BM&#x2032;</i> and <i>M&#x2032;B&#x2032;</i>, where <i>BB&#x2032;</i> represents the distance Venus itself has moved in the interval. And if you put yourself
in <i>B</i>&#x2019;s position on Venus the situation is exactly reversed. All of which is simply another
way of saying that what is a certain time on one body in space is another time on
another body in space. There is nothing definite in time.
</p>
<p><i>Prof. Cohen&#x2019;s Illustration.</i> Further bewildering possibilities are clearly outlined in this apt illustration:
&#x201c;If when you are going away on a long and continuous journey you write home at regular
intervals, you should not be surprised that with the best possible mail service your
letters will reach home at progressively longer intervals, since each letter will
have a greater distance to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>travel than its predecessor. If you were armed with instruments to hear the home clock
ticking, you would find that as your distance from home keeps on increasing, the intervals
between the successive ticks (that is, its seconds) grow longer, so that if you travelled
with the velocity of sound the home clock would seem to slow down to a standstill&#x2014;you
would never hear the next tick.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Precisely the same is true if you substitute light rays for sound waves. If with
the naked eye or with a telescope you watch a clock moving away from you, you will
find that its minute hand takes a longer time to cover its five-minute intervals than
does the chronometer in your hand, and if the clock travelled with the velocity of
light you would forever see the minute hand at precisely the same point. That which
is true of the clock is, of course, also true of all time intervals which it measures,
so that if you moved away from the earth with the velocity of light everything on
it would appear as still as on a painted canvas.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Your time has apparently come to a standstill in one position and is moving in another!
All this seems absurd enough, but it does show that time alone has little meaning.
</p>
<p><i>Minkowski&#x2019;s Conclusion.</i> The relativity theory <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>requires that we thoroughly reorganise our method of measuring time. But this is intimately
associated with our method of measuring space, the distance between two points. As
we proceed we find that space without time has little meaning, and vice versa. This
leads Minkowski to the conclusion that &#x201c;time by itself and space by itself are mere
shadows; they are only two aspects of a single and indivisible manner of coordinating
the facts of the physical world.&#x201d; Einstein incorporated this time-space idea in his
theory of relativity.
</p>
<p><i>How We Measure a Point in Space.</i> Suppose I say to you that the chemical laboratory of Columbia University faces Broadway;
would that locate the laboratory? Hardly, for any building along Broadway would face
Broadway. But suppose I add that it is situated at Broadway and 117th Street, south-east?
there could be little doubt then. But if, further, this laboratory would occupy but
part of the building, say the third floor; then the situation would be specified by
naming Broadway, 117th Street S. E., third floor. If Broadway represents length, 117th
Street width, and third floor height, we can see what is meant when we say that three
dimensions are required to locate a position in space.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>The Fourth Dimension.</i> A point on a line may be located by one dimension; a point on a wall requires two
dimensions; a point in the room, like the chemical laboratory above ground, needs
three. The layman cannot grasp the meaning of a fourth dimension; yet the mathematician
does imagine it, and plays with it in mathematical terms. Minkowski and Einstein picture
time as the fourth dimension. To them time occupies no more important position than
length, breadth, or thickness, and is as intimately related to these three as the
three are to one another. H.&nbsp;G. Wells, the novelist, has beautifully caught this spirit
when in his novel, &#x201c;The Time Machine,&#x201d; he makes his hero travel backwards and forwards
along time just as a man might go north or south. When the man with his time machine
goes forward he is in the future; when he goes backwards he is in the past.
</p>
<p>In reality, if we stop to think a minute, there is no valid reason for the non-existence
of a fourth dimension. If one, two and three dimensions, why not four&#x2014;and five and
six, for that matter? Theoretically at least there is no reason why the limit should
be set at three. However, our minds become sluggish when we attempt to picture dimensions
beyond three; just as an extraordinary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>effort on our part is needed to follow Einstein when he &#x201c;juggles&#x201d; with space and time.
</p>
<p>Our difficulty in imagining four dimensions may be likened to the difficulty two-dimensioned
beings would experience in imagining us, beings of the conventional three dimensions.
Suppose these two-dimensional beings were living on the surface of the earth; what
could they see? They could see nothing below and nothing above the surface. They would
see shifting surfaces as we walked about, but being sensitive to length and breadth
only, and not to height, they could gain no notion whatsoever of what we really look
like. It is thus with us when we attempt to picture four-dimensional space.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the analogy of the motion picture may help us somewhat. As everybody knows,
these motion pictures consist of a series of photographs which are shown in rapid
succession on the screen. Each photograph by itself conveys a sensation of space,
that is, of three dimensions; but one photograph rapidly following another conveys
the sensation of space and time&#x2014;four dimensions. Space and time are interlinked.
</p>
<p><i>The Time-space Idea Further Developed.</i> We have already alluded to the fact that objects in space moving with different velocities
build up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>different time intervals. Thus the velocity of the star Arcturus, if compared with
reference to the earth, moves at the rate of 200 miles a second. Its motion through
space is different from ours. Objects which, according to Lorentz, contract in the
direction of their motion to an extent proportional to their velocity, will contract
differently on the surface of Arcturus than on the earth. Our space is not Arcturus&#x2019;
space; neither is Arcturus&#x2019; time our time. And what is true of the discrepancies existing
between the space and time conceptions of the earth and Arcturus is true of any other
two bodies in space moving at different velocities.
</p>
<p>But is there no relationship existing between the space and time of one body in the
universe as compared to the space and time of another? Can we not find <i>something</i> which holds good for all bodies in the universe? We can. We can express it mathematically.
It is the concept of time and space interlinked; of time as the fourth dimension,
length, breadth and thickness being the other three; of time as one of four co-ordinates
and at right angles to the other three (a situation which requires a terrific stretch
of the imagination to visualize). The four dimensions are sufficient to co-ordinate
the time-space relationships <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>of all bodies in the cosmos, and hence have a universality which is totally lacking
when time and space are used independently of one another. The four components of
our time-space are up-and-down, right-and-left, backwards-and-forwards, and <i>sooner-and-later</i>.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;<i>Strain</i>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<i>Distortion</i>&#x201d; in <i>Space</i>. The four-dimensional unit has been given the name &#x201c;world-line,&#x201d; for the &#x201c;world-line&#x201d;
of any particle in space is in reality a complete history of that particle as it moves
about in space. Particles, we know, attract one another. If each particle is represented
by a world-line these world-lines will be deflected from their course owing to such
attraction.
</p>
<p>Imagine a bladder representing the universe, with lines on it representing world-lines.
Now squeeze the bladder. The world-lines are bent in various directions; they are
&#x201c;distorted.&#x201d; This illustrates the influence of gravity on these world-lines; it is
the &#x201c;strain&#x201d; brought about due to the force of attraction. The distorted bladder illustrates
even more, for it is a true representation of the real world.
</p>
<p><i>How Einstein&#x2019;s Conception of Time and Space Led to a New View of Gravitation.</i> In our conventional language we speak of the sun as exerting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>a &#x201c;force&#x201d; on the earth. We have seen, however, that this force brings about a &#x201c;distortion&#x201d;
or &#x201c;strain&#x201d; in world-lines; or, what amounts to the same thing, a &#x201c;distortion&#x201d; or
&#x201c;strain&#x201d; of time and space. The sun&#x2019;s &#x201c;force,&#x201d; the &#x201c;force&#x201d; of any body in space, is
the &#x201c;force&#x201d; due to gravity; and these &#x201c;forces&#x201d; may now be treated in terms of the
laws of time and space. &#x201c;The earth,&#x201d; Prof. Eddington tells us, &#x201c;moves in a curved
orbit, not because the sun exerts any direct pull, but because the earth is trying
to find the shortest way through a space and time which have been tangled up by an
influence radiating from the sun.&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e935src" href="#xd29e935">8</a>
</p>
<p>At this point Newton&#x2019;s conceptions fail, for his views and his laws do not include
&#x201c;strains&#x201d; in space. Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation must be supplanted by one which does
include such distortions. It is Einstein&#x2019;s great glory to have supplied us with this
new law.
</p>
<p><i>Einstein&#x2019;s Law of Gravitation.</i> This appears to be the only law which meets all requirements. It includes Newton&#x2019;s
law, and cannot be distinguished from it if our experiments are confined to the earth
and deal with relatively small velocities. But when we betake ourselves to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>some orbits in space, with a gravitational pull much greater than the earth&#x2019;s, and
when we deal with velocities comparable to that of light, the differences become marked.
</p>
<p><i>Einstein&#x2019;s Theory Scores Its First Great Victory.</i> In the beginning of this chapter we referred to the elaborate eclipse expedition
sent by the British to test the validity of Einstein&#x2019;s new theory of gravitation.
The British scientists would hardly have expended so much time and energy on this
theory of Einstein&#x2019;s but for the fact that Einstein had already scored one great victory.
What was it?
</p>
<p>Imagine but a single planet revolving about the sun. According to Newton&#x2019;s law of
gravitation, the planet&#x2019;s path would be that of an ellipse&#x2014;that is, oval&#x2014;and the planet
would travel indefinitely along this path. According to Einstein the path would also
be elliptical, but before a revolution would be quite completed, the planet would
start along a slightly advanced line, forming a new ellipse slightly in advance of
the first. The elliptic orbit slowly turns in the direction in which the planet is
moving. After many years&#x2014;centuries&#x2014;the orbit will be in a different direction.
</p>
<p>The rapidity of the orbit&#x2019;s change of direction depends on the velocity of the planet.
Mercury <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>moving at the rate of 30 miles a second is the fastest among the planets. It has the
further advantage over Venus or the earth in that its orbit, as we have said, is an
ellipse, whereas the orbits of Venus and the earth are nearly circular; and how are
you going to tell in which direction a circle is pointing?
</p>
<p>Observation tells us that the orbit of Mercury is advancing at the rate of 574 seconds
(of arc) per century. We can calculate how much of this is due to the gravitational
influence of other planets. It amounts to 532 seconds per century. What of the remaining
42 seconds?
</p>
<p>You might be inclined to attribute this shortcoming to experimental error. But when
all such possibilities are allowed for our mathematicians assure us that the discrepancy
is 30 times greater than any possible experimental error.
</p>
<p>This discrepancy between theory and observation remained one of the great puzzles
in astronomy until Einstein cleared up the mystery. According to Einstein&#x2019;s theory
the mathematics of the situation is simply this: in one revolution of the planet the
orbit will advance by a fraction of a revolution equal to three times the square of
the ratio of the velocity of the planet to the velocity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>of light. When we allow mathematicians to work this out we get the figure 43, which
is certainly close enough to 42 to be called identical with it.
</p>
<p><i>Still Another Victory?</i> Einstein&#x2019;s third prediction&#x2014;the shifting of spectral lines toward the red end of
the spectrum in the case of light coming to us from the stars of appreciable mass&#x2014;seems
to have been confirmed recently (March, 1920). &#x201c;The young physicists in Bonn,&#x201d; writes
Prof. Einstein to a friend, &#x201c;have now as good as certainty (<i lang="de">so gut wie sicher</i>) proved the red displacement of the spectral lines and have cleared up the grounds
of a previous disappointment.&#x201d;
</p>
<p><i>Summary.</i> Velocity, or movement in space, is at the basis of Einstein&#x2019;s work, as it was at
the basis of Newton&#x2019;s. But time and space no longer have the distinct meanings that
they had when examined with the help of Newton&#x2019;s equations. Time and space are not
independent but interdependent. They are meaningless when treated as separate entities,
giving results which may hold for one body in the universe but do not hold for any
other body. To get general laws which are applicable to the cosmos as a whole the
Fundamentals of Mechanics must be united.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Einstein&#x2019;s great achievement consists in applying this revised conception of space
and time to elucidate cosmical problems. &#x201c;World-lines,&#x201d; representing the progress
of particles in space, consisting of space-time combinations (the four dimensions),
are &#x201c;strained&#x201d; or &#x201c;distorted&#x201d; in space due to the attraction that bodies exhibit for
one another (the force of gravitation). On the other hand, gravitation itself&#x2014;more
universal than anything else in the universe&#x2014;may be interpreted in terms of strains
on world-lines, or, what amounts to the same thing, strains of space-time combinations.
This brings gravitation within the field of Einstein&#x2019;s conception of time and space.
</p>
<p>That Einstein&#x2019;s conception of the universe is an improvement upon that of Newton&#x2019;s
is evidenced by the fact that Einstein&#x2019;s law explains all that Newton&#x2019;s law does,
and also other facts which Newton&#x2019;s law is incapable of explaining. Among these may
be mentioned the distortion of the oval orbits of planets round the sun (confirmed
in the case of the planet Mercury), and the deviation of light rays in a gravitational
field (confirmed by the English Solar Eclipse Expedition).
</p>
<p><i>Einstein&#x2019;s Theories and the Inferences to be Drawn from Them.</i> Einstein&#x2019;s theories, supported <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>as they are by very convincing experiments, will probably profoundly influence philosophic
and perhaps religious thought, but they can hardly be said to be of immediate consequence
to the man in the street. As I have said elsewhere, Einstein&#x2019;s theories are not going
to add one bushel of wheat to war-torn and devastated Europe, but in their conception
of a cosmos decidedly at variance with anything yet conceived by any school of philosophy,
they will attract the universal attention of thinking men in all countries. The scientist
is immediately struck by the way Einstein has utilized the various achievements in
physics and mathematics to build up a co-ordinated system showing connecting links
where heretofore none were perceived. The philosopher is equally fascinated with a
theory, which, in detail extremely complex, shows a singular beauty of unity in design
when viewed as a whole. The revolutionary ideas propounded regarding time and space,
the brilliant way in which the most universal property of matter, gravitation, is
for the first time linked up with other properties of matter, and, above all, the
experimental confirmation of several of his more startling predictions&#x2014;always the
finest test of scientific merit&#x2014;stamps Einstein as one of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>those super-men who from time to time are sent to us to give us a peep into the beyond.
</p>
<p><i>Some Facts about Einstein Himself.</i> Albert Einstein was born in Germany some 45 years ago. At first he was engaged at
the Patent Bureau in Berne, and later became professor at the Zürich Polytechnic.
After a short stay at Prague University he accepted one of those tempting &#x201c;<span lang="de">Akademiker</span>&#x201d; professorships at the university of Berlin&#x2014;professorships which insure a comfortable
income to the recipient of one of them, little university work beyond, perhaps, one
lecture a week, and splendid facilities for research. A similar inducement enticed
the chemical philosopher, <span class="corr" id="xd29e987" title="Source: van">Van</span> &#x2019;t Hoff, to leave his Amsterdam, and the Swedes came perilously near losing their
most illustrious scientist, Arrhenius.
</p>
<p>Einstein published his first paper on relativity in 1905, when not more than 30 years
old. Of this paper Planck, the Nobel Laureate in physics this year, has offered this
opinion: &#x201c;It surpasses in boldness everything previously suggested in speculative
natural philosophy and even in the philosophical theories of knowledge. The revolution
introduced into the physical conceptions of the world is only to be compared in extent
and depth with that brought about by the introduction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>of the Copernican system of the universe.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Einstein published a full exposition of the relativity theory in 1916.
</p>
<p>During the momentous years of 1914&#x2013;19, Einstein quietly pursued his labors. There
seems to be some foundation for the belief that the ways of the German High Command
found little favor in his eyes. At any rate, he was not one of the forty professors
who signed the famous manifesto extolling Germany&#x2019;s aims. &#x201c;We know for a fact,&#x201d; writes
Dr. O.&nbsp;A. Rankine, of the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, &#x201c;that
Einstein never was employed on war work. Whatever may have been Germany&#x2019;s mistakes
in other directions, she left her men of science severely alone. In fact, they were
encouraged to continue in their normal occupations. Einstein undoubtedly received
a large measure of support from the Imperial Government, even when the German armies
were being driven back across Belgium.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Quite recently (June, 1920) the <i>Barnard</i> Medal of Columbia University was conferred on him &#x201c;in recognition of his highly original
and fruitful development of the fundamental concepts of physics through application
of mathematics.&#x201d; In acknowledging the honor, Prof. Einstein wrote to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>President Butler that &#x201c;&#x2026; quite apart from the personal satisfaction, I believe I may
regard your decision [to confer the medal upon him] as a harbinger of a better time
in which a sense of international solidarity will once more unite scholars of the
various countries.&#x201d;

<p class="first">Sir Oliver Lodge goes to the extreme of pinning his faith in the reality of this ether
rather than in that of matter. Witness the following statement he made recently before
a New York audience:
</p>
<p>&#x201c;To my mind the ether of space is a substantial reality with extraordinarily perfect
properties, with an immense amount of energy stored up in it, with a constitution
which we must discover, but a substantial reality far more impressive than that of
matter. Empty space, as we call it, is full of ether, but it makes no appeal to our
senses. The appearance is as if it were nothing. It is the most important thing in
the material universe. I believe that matter is a modification of ether, a very porous
substance, a thing more analogous to a cobweb or the Milky Way or something very slight
and unsubstantial, as compared to ether.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>And again:
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The properties of ether seem to be perfect. Matter is less so; it has friction and
elasticity. No imperfection has been discovered in the ether space. It doesn&#x2019;t wear
out; there is no dissipation of energy; there is no friction. Ether is material, yet
it is not matter; both are substantial realities in physics, but it is the ether of
space that holds things together and acts as a cement. My business is to call attention
to the whole world of etherealness of things, and I have made it a subject of thirty
years&#x2019; study, but we must admit that there is no getting hold of ether except indirectly.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I consider the ether of space,&#x201d; says Lodge, in conclusion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>&#x201c;the one substantial thing in the universe.&#x201d; And Lodge is certainly entitled to his

<p class="first">For the benefit of those readers who wish to gain a deeper insight into the relativity
principle, we shall here discuss it very briefly.
</p>
<p>Newton and Galileo had developed a relativity principle in mechanics which may be
stated as follows: If one system of reference is in uniform rectilinear motion with
respect to another system of reference, then whatever physical laws are deduced from
the first system hold true for the second system. The two systems are <i>equivalent</i>. If the two systems be represented by <span class="inlineMath"><i>xyz</i></span> and <span class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f94.2.svg" alt="x prime y prime z prime" title="x prime y prime z prime" class="f94.2frml"></span>, and if they move with the velocity of <i>v</i> along the <i>x</i>-axis with respect to one another, then the two systems are mathematically related
thus:
<span class="labeledMath"><span class="phantom leftMathLabel">(1)</span><span id="f95.3" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f95.3.svg" alt="x prime equals x minus v t comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z comma t prime equals t comma" title="x prime equals x minus v t comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z comma t prime equals t comma" class="f95.3frml"></span><span class="rightMathLabel">(1)</span></span>
</p>
<p>and this immediately provides us with a means of transforming the laws of one system
to those of another.
</p>
<p>With the development of electrodynamics (which we may call electricity in motion)
difficulties arose which equations in mechanics of type (<a href="#f95.3">1</a>) could no longer solve. These difficulties merely increased when Maxwell showed that
light must be regarded as an electromagnetic phenomenon. For suppose we wish to investigate
the motion of a source of light (which may be the equivalent of the motion of the
earth with reference to the sun) with respect to the velocity of the light it emits&#x2014;a
typical example of the study of <i>moving systems</i>&#x2014;how are we to coordinate the electrodynamical and mechanical elements? Or, again,
suppose we wish to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>investigate the velocity of electrons shot out from radium with a speed comparable
to that of light, how are we to coordinate the two branches in tracing the course
of these negative particles of electricity?
</p>
<p>It was difficulties such as these that led to the Lorentz-Einstein modifications of
the Newton-Galileo relativity equations (<a href="#f95.3">1</a>). The Lorentz-Einstein equations are expressed in the form:
<span class="labeledMath"><span class="phantom leftMathLabel">(2)</span><span id="f95.1" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f95.1.svg" alt="x prime equals StartFraction x minus v t Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction v squared Over c EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z comma t prime equals StartStartFraction t minus StartFraction v Over c squared EndFraction dot x OverOver StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction v squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndEndFraction comma" title="x prime equals StartFraction x minus v t Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction v squared Over c EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z comma t prime equals StartStartFraction t minus StartFraction v Over c squared EndFraction dot x OverOver StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction v squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndEndFraction comma" class="f95.1frml"></span><span class="rightMathLabel">(2)</span></span>

state of motion). Here, you see, electrodynamical systems (light and therefore &#x201c;ray&#x201d;
velocities such as those due to electrons) are brought into play.
</p>
<p>This gives us Einstein&#x2019;s <i>special theory of relativity</i>. From it Einstein deduced some startling conceptions of time and space.

<p class="first">How the <i>special</i> theory of relativity (see <a href="#note4">Note 4</a>) led to the <i>general</i> theory of relativity (which included gravitation) may now be briefly traced.
</p>
<p>When we speak of electrons, or negative particles of electricity, in motion, we are
speaking of <i>energy</i> in motion. Now these electrons when in motion exhibit properties that are very similar
to matter in motion. Whatever deviations there are are due to the enormous velocity
of these electrons, and this velocity, as has already been pointed out, is comparable
to that of light; whereas before the advent of the electron, the velocity of no particles
comparable to that of light had ever been measured.
</p>
<p>According to present views &#x201c;all inertia of matter consists only of the inertia of
the latent energy in it; &#x2026; everything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>that we know of the inertia of energy holds without exception for the inertia of <i>matter</i>.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Now it is on the assumption that inertial mass and gravitational &#x201c;pull&#x201d; are equivalent
that the mass of a body is determined by its <i>weight</i>. What is true of matter should be true of energy.
</p>
<p>The special theory of relativity, however, takes into account only inertia (&#x201c;inertial
<i>mass</i>&#x201d;) but not gravitation (gravitational pull or <i>weight</i>) of energy. When a body absorbs energy equation 2 (see <a href="#note4">Note 4</a>) will record a gain in inertia but not in weight&#x2014;which is contrary to one of the
fundamental facts in mechanics.
</p>
<p>This means that a more <i>general</i> theory of relativity is required to include gravitational phenomena. Hence Einstein&#x2019;s
<i>General Theory of Relativity</i>. Hence the approach to a new theory of gravitation. Hence &#x201c;the setting up of a differential
equation which comprises the motion of a body under the influence of both <i>inertia and gravity</i>, and which symbolically expresses the relativity of motions.&#x2026; The differential law
must always preserve the same form, irrespective of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e1352" title="Source: sytem">system</span> of coordinates to which it is referred, so that no system of coordinates enjoys a
preference to any other.&#x201d; (For the general form of the equation and for an excellent
discussion of its significance, see Freundlich&#x2019;s monograph, pages 27&#x2013;33.)

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are several kinds of theory in physics. Most of them are constructive. These
attempt to build a picture of complex phenomena out of some relatively simple proposition.
The kinetic theory of gases, for instance, attempts to refer to molecular movement
the mechanical thermal, and diffusional properties of gases. When we say that we understand
a group of natural phenomena, we mean that we have found a constructive theory which
embraces them.
</p>
<p><i>Theories of Principle.</i>&#x2014;But in addition to this most weighty group of theories, there is another group consisting
of what I call theories of principle. These employ the analytic, not the synthetic
method. Their starting-point and foundation are not hypothetical constituents, but
empirically observed general properties of phenomena, principles from which mathematical
formulæ are deduced of such a kind that they apply to every case which presents itself.
Thermodynamics, for instance, starting from the fact that perpetual motion never occurs
in ordinary experience, attempts to deduce from this, by analytic processes, a theory
which will apply in every case. The merit of constructive theories is their comprehensiveness,
adaptability, and clarity, that of the theories of principle, their logical perfection,
and the security of their foundation.
</p>
<p>The theory of relativity is a theory of principle. To understand it, the principles
on which it rests must be grasped. But before stating these it is necessary to point
out that the theory of relativity is like a house with two separate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>stories, the special relativity theory and the general theory of relativity.
</p>
<p>Since the time of the ancient Greeks it has been well known that in describing the
motion of a body we must refer to another body. The motion of a railway train is described
with reference to the ground, of a planet with reference to the total assemblage of
visible fixed stars. In physics the bodies to which motions are spatially referred
are termed systems of coordinates. The laws of mechanics of Galileo and Newton can
be formulated only by using a system of coordinates.
</p>
<p>The state of motion of a system of coordinates can not be chosen arbitrarily if the
laws of mechanics are to hold good (it must be free from twisting and from acceleration).
The system of coordinates employed in mechanics is called an inertia-system. The state
of motion of an inertia-system, so far as mechanics are concerned, is not restricted
by nature to one condition. The condition in the following proposition suffices; a
system of coordinates moving in the same direction and at the same rate as a system
of inertia is itself a system of inertia. The special relativity theory is therefore
the application of the following proposition to any natural process: &#x201c;Every law of
nature which holds good with respect to a coordinate system <i>K</i> must also hold good for any other system <i>K&#x2032;</i> provided that <i>K</i> and <i>K&#x2032;</i> are in uniform movement of translation.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The second principle on which the special relativity theory rests is that of the constancy
of the velocity of light in a vacuum. Light in a vacuum has a definite and constant
velocity, independent of the velocity of its source. Physicists owe their confidence
in this proposition to the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electro-dynamics.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>The two principles which I have mentioned have received strong experimental confirmation,
but do not seem to be logically compatible. The special relativity theory achieved
their logical reconciliation by making a change in kinematics, that is to say, in
the doctrine of the physical laws of space and time. It became evident that a statement
of the coincidence of two events could have a meaning only in connection with a system
of coordinates, that the mass of bodies and the rate of movement of clocks must depend
on their state of motion with regard to the coordinates.
</p>
<p><i>The Older Physics.</i>&#x2014;But the older physics, including the laws of motion of Galileo and Newton, clashed
with the relativistic kinematics that I have indicated. The latter gave origin to
certain generalized mathematical conditions with which the laws of nature would have
to conform if the two fundamental principles were compatible. Physics had to be modified.
The most notable change was a new law of motion for (very rapidly) moving mass-points,
and this soon came to be verified in the case of electrically-laden particles. The
most important result of the special relativity system concerned the inert mass of
a material system. It became evident that the inertia of such a system must depend
on its energy-content, so that we were driven to the conception that inert mass was
nothing else than latent energy. The doctrine of the conservation of mass lost its
independence and became merged in the doctrine of conservation of energy.
</p>
<p>The special relativity theory which was simply a systematic extension of the electro-dynamics
of Maxwell and Lorentz, had consequences which reached beyond itself. Must the independence
of physical laws with regard to a system of coordinates be limited to systems of coordinates
in uniform movement of translation with regard to one another? What <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>has nature to do with the coordinate systems that we propose and with their motions?
Although it may be necessary for our descriptions of nature to employ systems of coordinates
that we have selected arbitrarily, the choice should not be limited in any way so
far as their state of motion is concerned. (General theory of relativity.) The application
of this general theory of relativity was found to be in conflict with a well-known
experiment, according to which it appeared that the weight and the inertia of a body
depended on the same constants (identity of inert and heavy masses). Consider the
case of a system of coordinates which is conceived as being in stable rotation relative
to a system of inertia in the Newtonian sense. The forces which, relatively to this
system, are centrifugal must, in the Newtonian sense, be attributed to inertia. But
these centrifugal forces are, like gravitation, proportional to the mass of the bodies.
Is it not, then, possible to regard the system of coordinates as at rest, and the
centrifugal forces as gravitational? The interpretation seemed obvious, but classical
mechanics forbade it.
</p>
<p>This slight sketch indicates how a generalized theory of relativity must include the
laws of gravitation, and actual pursuit of the conception has justified the hope.
But the way was harder than was expected, because it contradicted Euclidian geometry.
In other words, the laws according to which material bodies are arranged in space
do not exactly agree with the laws of space prescribed by the Euclidian geometry of
solids. This is what is meant by the phrase &#x201c;a warp in space.&#x201d; The fundamental concepts
&#x201c;straight,&#x201d; &#x201c;plane,&#x201d; etc., accordingly lose their exact meaning in physics.
</p>
<p>In the generalized theory of relativity, the doctrine of space and time, kinematics,
is no longer one of the absolute foundations of general physics. The geometrical states
of bodies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>and the rates of clocks depend in the first place on their gravitational fields, which
again are produced by the material system concerned.
</p>
<p>Thus the new theory of gravitation diverges widely from that of Newton with respect
to its basal principle. But in practical application the two agree so closely that
it has been difficult to find cases in which the actual differences could be subjected
to observation. As yet only the following have been suggested:
</p>
<p>1. The distortion of the oval orbits of planets round the sun (confirmed in the case
of the planet Mercury).
</p>
<p>2. The deviation of light-rays in a gravitational field (confirmed by the English
Solar Eclipse expedition).
</p>
<p>3. The shifting of spectral lines towards the red end of the spectrum in the case
of light coming to us from stars of appreciable mass (not yet confirmed).
</p>
<p>The great attraction of the theory is its logical consistency. If any deduction from
it should prove untenable, it must be given up. A modification of it seems impossible
without destruction of the whole.

<p>No one must think that Newton&#x2019;s great creation can be overthrown in any real sense
by this or by any other theory. His clear and wide ideas will for ever retain their
significance as the foundation on which our modern conceptions of physics have been
built.

<p class="first">&#x2026; In the treatment of Maxwell&#x2019;s equations of the electromagnetic field, several investigators
realized the importance of deducing the form of the equations when applied to a system
moving with a uniform velocity. One object of such an investigation would be to determine
such a set of transformation formulæ as would leave the mathematical form of the equations
unaltered. The necessary relations between the new space-coordinates, those applying
to the moving system, and the original set were of course obvious; and elementary
methods led to the deduction of a new variable which should replace the time coordinate.
This step was taken by Lorentz and also, I believe, by Larmor and by Voigt. The mathematical
deductions and applications in the hands of these men were extremely beautiful, and
are probably well known to you all.
</p>
<p>Lorentz&#x2019; paper on this subject appeared in the Proceedings of the Amsterdam Academy
in 1904. In the following year there was published in the <i lang="de">Annalen der Physik</i> a paper by Einstein, written without any knowledge of the work of Lorentz, in which
he arrived at the same transformation equations as did the latter, but with an entirely
different and fundamentally new interpretation. Einstein called attention in his paper
to the lack of definiteness in the concepts of time and space, as ordinarily stated
and used. He analyzed clearly the definitions and postulates which were necessary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>before one could speak with exactness of a length or of an interval of time. He disposed
forever of the propriety of speaking of the &#x201c;true&#x201d; length of a rod or of the &#x201c;true&#x201d;
duration of time, showing, in fact, that the numerical values which we attach to lengths
or intervals of time depend upon the definitions and postulates which we adopt. The
words &#x201c;absolute&#x201d; space or time intervals are devoid of meaning. As an illustration
of what is meant Einstein discussed two possible ways of measuring the length of a
rod when it is moving in the direction of its own length with a uniform velocity,
that is, after having adopted a scale of length, two ways of assigning a number to
the length of the rod concerned. One method is to imagine the observer moving with
the rod, applying along its length the measuring scale, and reading off the positions
of the ends of the rod. Another method would be to have two observers at rest on the
body with reference to which the rod has the uniform velocity, so stationed along
the line of motion of the rod that as the rod moves past them they can note simultaneously
on a stationary measuring scale the positions of the two ends of the rod. Einstein
showed that, accepting two postulates which need no defense at this time, the two
methods of measurements would lead to different numerical values, and, further, that
the divergence of the two results would increase as the velocity of the rod was increased.
In assigning a number, therefore, to the length of a moving rod, one must make a choice
of the method to be used in measuring it. Obviously the preferable method is to agree
that the observer shall move with the rod, carrying his measuring instrument with
him. This disposes of the problem of measuring space relations. The observed fact
that, if we measure the length of the rod on different days, or when the rod is lying
in different positions, we always <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>obtain the same value offers no information concerning the &#x201c;real&#x201d; length of the rod.
It may have changed, or it may not. It must always be remembered that measurement
of the length of a rod is simply a process of comparison between it and an arbitrary
standard, <i>e.g.</i>, a meter-rod or yard-stick. In regard to the problem of assigning numbers to intervals
of time, it must be borne in mind that, strictly speaking, we do not &#x201c;measure&#x201d; such
intervals, <i>i.e.</i>, that we do not select a unit interval of time and find how many times it is contained
in the interval in question. (Similarly, we do not &#x201c;measure&#x201d; the pitch of a sound
or the temperature of a room.) Our practical instruments for assigning numbers to
time-intervals depend in the main upon our agreeing to believe that a pendulum swings
in a perfectly uniform manner, each vibration taking the same time as the next one.
Of course we cannot <i>prove</i> that this is true, it is, strictly speaking, a definition of what we mean by equal
intervals of time; and it is not a particularly good definition at that. Its limitations
are sufficiently obvious. The best way to proceed is to consider the concept of uniform
velocity, and then, using the idea of some entity having such a uniform velocity,
to define equal intervals of time as such intervals as are required for the entity
to traverse equal lengths. These last we have already defined. What is required in
addition is to adopt some moving entity as giving our definition of uniform velocity.
Considering our known universe it is self-evident that we should choose in our definition
of uniform velocity the velocity of light, since this selection could be made by an
observer anywhere in our universe. Having agreed then to illustrate by the words &#x201c;uniform
velocity&#x201d; that of light, our definition of equal intervals of time is complete. This
implies, of course, that there is no uncertainty on our part as to the fact that the
velocity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>light always has the same value at any one point in the universe to any observer,
quite regardless of the source of light. In other words, the postulate that this is
true underlies our definition. Following this method Einstein developed a system of
measuring both space and time intervals. As a matter of fact his system is identically
that which we use in daily life with reference to events here on the earth. He further
showed that if a man were to measure the length of a rod, for instance, on the earth
and then were able to carry the rod and his measuring apparatus to Mars, the sun,
or to Arcturus he would obtain the same numerical value for the length in all places
and at all times. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that any statement is implied as to whether the
length of the rod has remained unchanged or not; such words do not have any meaning&#x2014;remember
that we can not speak of true length. It is thus clear that an observer living on
the earth would have a definite system of units in terms of which to express space
and time intervals, <i>i.e.</i>, he would have a definite system of space coordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) and a definite time coordinate (<i>t</i>); and similarly an observer living on Mars would have his system of coordinates (<i>x&#x2032;</i>, <i>y&#x2032;</i>, <i>z&#x2032;</i>, <i>t&#x2032;</i>). Provided that one observer has a definite uniform velocity with reference to the
other, it is a comparatively simple matter to deduce the mathematical relations between
the two sets of coordinates. When Einstein did this, he arrived at the same transformation
formulæ as those used by Lorentz in his development of Maxwell&#x2019;s equations. The latter
had shown that, using these formulæ, the form of the laws for all electromagnetic
phenomena maintained the same form; so Einstein&#x2019;s method proves that using his system
of measurement an observer, anywhere in the universe, would as the result of his own
investigation of electromagnetic phenomena arrive at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>same mathematical statement of them as any other observer, provided only that the
relative-velocity of the two observers was uniform.
</p>
<p>Einstein discussed many other most important questions at this time; but it is not
necessary to refer to them in connection with the present subject. So far as this
is concerned, the next important step to note is that taken in the famous address
of Minkowski, in 1908, on the subject of &#x201c;Space and Time.&#x201d; It would be difficult to
overstate the importance of the concepts advanced by Minkowski. They marked the beginning
of a new period in the philosophy of physics. I shall not attempt to explain his ideas
in detail, but shall confine myself to a few general statements. His point of view
and his line of development of the theme are absolutely different from those of Lorentz
or of Einstein; but in the end he makes use of the same transformation formulæ. His
great contribution consists in giving us a new geometrical picture of their meaning.
It is scarcely fair to call Minkowski&#x2019;s development a picture; for to us a picture
can never have more than three dimensions, our senses limit us; while his picture
calls for perception of four dimensions. It is this fact that renders any even semi-popular
discussion of Minkowski&#x2019;s work so impossible. We can all see that for us to describe
any event a knowledge of four coordinates is necessary, three for the space specification
and one for the time. A complete picture could be given then by a point in four dimensions.
All four coordinates are necessary: we never observe an event except at a certain
time, and we never observe an instant of time except with reference to space. Discussing
the laws of electromagnetic phenomena, Minkowski showed how in a space of four dimensions,
by a suitable definition of axes, the mathematical transformation of Lorentz and Einstein
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>could be described by a rotation of the set of axes. We are all accustomed to a rotation
of our ordinary cartesian set of axes describing the position of a point. We ordinarily
choose our axes at any location on the earth as follows: one vertical, one east and
west, one north and south. So if we move from any one laboratory to another, we change
our axes; they are always orthogonal, but in moving from place to place there is a
rotation. Similarly, Minkowski showed that if we choose four orthogonal axes at any
point on the earth, according to his method, to represent a space-time point using
the method of measuring space and time intervals as outlined by Einstein; and, if
an observer on Arcturus used a similar set of axes and the method of measurement which
he naturally would, the set of axes of the latter could be obtained from those of
the observer on the earth by a pure rotation (and naturally a transfer of the origin).
This is a beautiful geometrical result. To complete my statement of the method, I
must add that instead of using as his fourth axis one along which numerical values
of time are laid off, Minkowski defined his fourth coordinate as the product of time
and the imaginary constant, the square root of minus one. This introduction of imaginary
quantities might be expected, possibly, to introduce difficulties; but, in reality,
it is the very essence of the simplicity of the geometrical description just given
of the rotation of the sets of axes. It thus appears that different observers situated
at different points in the universe would each have their own set of axes, all different,
yet all connected by the fact that any one can be rotated so as to coincide with any
other. This means that there is no one direction in the four-dimensional space that
corresponds to time for all observers. Just as with reference to the earth there is
no direction which can be called vertical for all observers living on the earth. In
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>sense of an <i>absolute</i> meaning the words &#x201c;up and down,&#x201d; &#x201c;before and after,&#x201d; &#x201c;sooner or later,&#x201d; are entirely
meaningless.
</p>
<p>This concept of Minkowski&#x2019;s may be made clearer, perhaps, by the following process
of thought. If we take a section through our three-dimensional space, we have a plane,
<i>i.e.</i>, a two-dimensional space. Similarly, if a section is made through a four-dimensional
space, one of three dimensions is obtained. Thus, for an observer on the earth a definite
section of Minkowski&#x2019;s four-dimensional space will give us our ordinary three-dimensional
one; so that this section will, as it were, break up Minkowski&#x2019;s space into our space
and give us our ordinary time. Similarly, a different section would have to be used
to the observer on Arcturus; but by a suitable selection he would get his own familiar
three-dimensional space and his own time. Thus the space defined by Minkowski is completely
isotropic in reference to measured lengths and times, there is absolutely no difference
between any two directions in an absolute sense; for any particular observer, of course,
a particular section will cause the space to fall apart so as to suit his habits of
measurement; any section, however, taken at random will do the same thing for some
observer somewhere. From another point of view, that of Lorentz and Einstein, it is
obvious that, since this four-dimensional space is isotropic, the expression of the
laws of electromagnetic phenomena take identical mathematical forms when expressed
by any observer.
</p>
<p>The question of course must be raised as to what can be said in regard to phenomena
which so far as we know do not have an electromagnetic origin. In particular what
can be done with respect to gravitational phenomena? Before, however, showing how
this problem was attacked by Einstein; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>and the fact that the subject of my address is Einstein&#x2019;s work on gravitation shows
that ultimately I shall explain this, I must emphasize another feature of Minkowski&#x2019;s
geometry. To describe the space-time characteristics of any event a point, defined
by its four coordinates, is sufficient; so, if one observes the life-history of any
entity, <i>e.g.</i>, a particle of matter, a light-wave, etc., he observes a sequence of points in the
space-time continuum; that is, the life-history of any entity is described fully by
a line in this space. Such a line was called by Minkowski a &#x201c;world-line.&#x201d; Further,
from a different point of view, all of our observations of nature are in reality observations
of coincidences, <i>e.g.</i>, if one reads a thermometer, what he does is to note the coincidence of the end of
the column of mercury with a certain scale division on the thermometer tube. In other
words, thinking of the world-line of the end of the mercury column and the world-line
of the scale division, what we have observed was the intersection or crossing of these
lines. In a similar manner any observation may be analyzed; and remembering that light
rays, a point on the retina of the eye, etc., all have their world-lines, it will
be recognized that it is a perfectly accurate statement to say that every observation
is the perception of the intersection of world-lines. Further, since all we know of
a world-line is the result of observations, it is evident that we do not know a world-line
as a continuous series of points, but simply as a series of discontinuous points,
each point being where the particular world-line in question is crossed by another
world-line.
</p>
<p>It is clear, moreover, that for the description of a world-line we are not limited
to the particular set of four orthogonal axes adopted by Minkowski. We can choose
any set of four-dimensional axes we wish. It is further evident that the mathematical
expression for the coincidence of two points is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>absolutely independent of our selection of reference axes. If we change our axes,
we will change the coordinates of both points simultaneously, so that the question
of axes ceases to be of interest. But our so-called laws of nature are nothing but
descriptions in mathematical language of our observations; we observe only coincidences;
a sequence of coincidences when put in mathematical terms takes a form which is independent
of the selection of reference axes; therefore the mathematical expression of our laws
of nature, of every character, must be such that their form does not change if we
make a transformation of axes. This is a simple but far-reaching deduction.
</p>
<p>There is a geometrical method of picturing the effect of a change of axes of reference,
<i>i.e.</i>, of a mathematical transformation. To a man in a railway coach the path of a drop
of water does not appear vertical, <i>i.e.</i>, it is not parallel to the edge of the window; still less so does it appear vertical
to a man performing man&#x153;uvres in an airplane. This means that whereas with reference
to axes fixed to the earth the path of the drop is vertical; with reference to other
axes, the path is not. Or, stating the conclusion in general language, changing the
axes of reference (or effecting a mathematical transformation) in general changes
the shape of any line. If one imagines the line forming a part of the space, it is
evident that if the space is deformed by compression or expansion the shape of the
line is changed, and if sufficient care is taken it is clearly possible, by deforming
the space, to make the line take any shape desired, or better stated, any shape specified
by the previous change of axes. It is thus possible to picture a mathematical transformation
as a deformation of space. Thus I can draw a line on a sheet of paper or of rubber
and by bending and stretching the sheet, I can make the line assume a great variety
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>of shapes; each of these new shapes is a picture of a suitable transformation.
</p>
<p>Now, consider world-lines in our four-dimensional space. The complete record of all
our knowledge is a series of sequences of intersections of such lines. By analogy
I can draw in ordinary space a great number of intersecting lines on a sheet of rubber;
I can then bend and deform the sheet to please myself; by so doing I do not introduce
any new intersections nor do I alter in the least the sequence of intersections. So
in the space of our world-lines, the space may be deformed in any imaginable manner
without introducing any new intersections or changing the sequence of the existing
intersections. It is this sequence which gives us the mathematical expression of our
so-called experimental laws; a deformation of our space is equivalent mathematically
to a transformation of axes, consequently we see why it is that the form of our laws
must be the same when referred to any and all sets of axes, that is, must remain unaltered
by any mathematical transformation.
</p>
<p>Now, at last we come to gravitation. We can not imagine any world-line simpler than
that of a particle of matter left to itself; we shall therefore call it a &#x201c;straight&#x201d;
line. Our experience is that two particles of matter attract one another<span class="corr" id="xd29e1501" title="Not in source">.</span> Expressed in terms of world-lines, this means that, if the world-lines of two isolated
particles come near each other, the lines, instead of being straight, will be deflected
or bent in towards each other. The world-line of any one particle is therefore deformed;
and we have just seen that a deformation is the equivalent of a mathematical transformation.
In other words, for any one particle it is possible to replace the effect of a gravitational
field at any instant by a mathematical transformation of axes. The statement that
this is always possible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>for any particle at any instant is Einstein&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;Principle of Equivalence.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Let us rest for a moment, while I call attention to a most interesting coincidence,
not to be thought of as an intersection of world-lines. It is said that Newton&#x2019;s thoughts
were directed to the observation of gravitational phenomena by an apple falling on
his head; from this striking event he passed by natural steps to a consideration of
the universality of gravitation. Einstein in describing his mental process in the
evolution of his law of gravitation says that his attention was called to a new point
of view by discussing his experiences with a man whose fall from a high building he
had just witnessed. The man fortunately suffered no serious injuries and assured Einstein
that in the course of his fall he had not been conscious in the least of any pull
downward on his body. In mathematical language, with reference to axes moving with
the man the force of gravity had disappeared. This is a case where by the transfer
of the axes from the earth itself to the man, the force of the gravitational field
is annulled. The converse change of axes from the falling man to a point on the earth
could be considered as introducing the force of gravity into the equations of motion.
Another illustration of the introduction into our equations of a force by a means
of a change of axes is furnished by the ordinary treatment of a body in uniform rotation
about an axis. For instance, in the case of a so-called conical pendulum, that is,
the motion of a bob suspended from a fixed point by string, which is so set in motion
that the bob describes a horizontal circle and the string therefore describes a circular
cone, if we transfer our axes from the earth and have them rotate around the vertical
line through the fixed point with the same angular velocity as the bob, it is necessary
to introduce into our equations of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>motion a fictitious &#x201c;force&#x201d; called the centrifugal force. No one ever thinks of this
force other than as a mathematical quantity introduced into the equations for the
sake of simplicity of treatment; no physical meaning is attached to it. Why should
there be to any other so-called &#x201c;force,&#x201d; which like centrifugal force, is independent
of the nature of the matter? Again, here on the earth our sensation of weight is interpreted
mathematically by combining expressions for centrifugal force and gravity; we have
no distinct sensation for either separately. Why then is there any difference in the
essence of the two? Why not consider them both as brought into our equations by the
agency of mathematical transformations? This is Einstein&#x2019;s point of view.
</p>
<p>Granting, then, the principle of equivalence, we can so choose axes at any point at
any instant that the gravitational field will disappear; these axes are therefore
of what Eddington calls the &#x201c;Galilean&#x201d; type, the simplest possible. Consider, that
is, an observer in a box, or compartment, which is falling with the acceleration of
the gravitational field at that point. He would not be conscious of the field. If
there were a projectile fired off in this compartment, the observer would describe
its path as being straight. In this space the infinitesimal interval between two space-time
points would then be given by the formula
<span class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f115.1.svg" alt="d s squared equals d x 1 squared plus d x 2 Subscript 2 Baseline plus d x 3 squared plus d x 2 Subscript 4 Baseline comma" title="d s squared equals d x 1 squared plus d x 2 Subscript 2 Baseline plus d x 3 squared plus d x 2 Subscript 4 Baseline comma" class="f115.1frml"></span>
</p>
<p>where <i>ds</i> is the interval and <span class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f115.2.svg" alt="x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 comma x 4" title="x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 comma x 4" class="f115.2frml"></span> are coordinates. If we make a mathematical transformation, <i>i.e.</i>, use another set of axes, this interval would obviously take the form
<span class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f115.3.svg" alt="d s squared equals g 11 d x 33 squared plus g 22 d x 2 squared plus g 33 d x 3 squared plus g 44 d x 2 Subscript 4 Baseline plus 2 g 12 d x 1 d x 2 plus normal e normal t normal c period comma" title="d s squared equals g 11 d x 33 squared plus g 22 d x 2 squared plus g 33 d x 3 squared plus g 44 d x 2 Subscript 4 Baseline plus 2 g 12 d x 1 d x 2 plus normal e normal t normal c period comma" class="f115.3frml"></span>
</p>
<p>where <span class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f115.4.svg" alt="x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3" title="x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3" class="f115.4frml"></span> and <span class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f115.5.svg" alt="x 4" title="x 4" class="f115.5frml"></span> are now coordinates referring to the new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>axes. This relation involves ten coefficients, the coefficients defining the transformation.
</p>
<p>But of course a certain dynamical value is also attached to the <i>g</i>&#x2019;s, because by the transfer of our axes from the Galilean type we have made a change
which is equivalent to the introduction of a gravitational field; and the <i>g</i>&#x2019;s must specify the field. That is, these <i>g</i>&#x2019;s are the expressions of our experiences, and hence their values can not depend upon
the use of any special axes; the values must be the same for all selections. In other
words, whatever function of the coordinates any one <i>g</i> is for one set of axes, if other axes are chosen, this <i>g</i> must still be the same function of the new coordinates. There are ten <i>g</i>&#x2019;s defined by differential equations; so we have ten covariant equations. Einstein
showed how these <i>g</i>&#x2019;s could be regarded as generalized potentials of the field. Our own experiments and
observations upon gravitation have given us a certain knowledge concerning its potential;
that is, we know a value for it which must be so near the truth that we can properly
call it at least a first approximation. Or, stated differently, if Einstein succeeds
in deducing the rigid value for the gravitational potential in any field, it must
degenerate to the Newtonian value for the great majority of cases with which we have
actual experience. Einstein&#x2019;s method, then, was to investigate the functions (or equations)
which would satisfy the mathematical conditions just described. A transformation from
the axes used by the observer in the following box may be made so as to introduce
into the equations the gravitational field recognized by an observer on the earth
near the box; but this, obviously, would not be the general gravitational field, because
the field changes as one moves over the surface of the earth. A solution found, therefore,
as just indicated, would not be the one sought for the general field; and another
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>must be found which is less stringent than the former but reduces to it as a special
case. He found himself at liberty to make a selection from among several possibilities,
and for several reasons chose the simplest solution. He then tested this decision
by seeing if his formulæ would degenerate to Newton&#x2019;s law for the limiting case of
velocities small when compared with that of light, because this condition is satisfied
in those cases to which Newton&#x2019;s law applies. His formulæ satisfied this test, and
he therefore was able to announce a &#x201c;law of gravitation,&#x201d; of which Newton&#x2019;s was a
special form for a simple case.
</p>
<p>To the ordinary scholar the difficulties surmounted by Einstein in his investigations
appear stupendous. It is not improbable that the statement which he is alleged to
have made to his editor, that only ten men in the world could understand his treatment
of the subject, is true. I am fully prepared to believe it, and wish to add that I
certainly am not one of the ten. But I can also say that, after a careful and serious
study of his papers, I feel confident that there is nothing in them which I can not
understand, given the time to become familiar with the special mathematical processes
used. The more I work over Einstein&#x2019;s papers, the more impressed I am, not simply
by his genius in viewing the problem, but also by his great technical skill.
</p>
<p>Following the path outlined, Einstein, as just said, arrived at certain mathematical
laws for a gravitational field, laws which reduced to Newton&#x2019;s form in most cases
where observations are possible, but which led to different conclusions in a few cases,
knowledge concerning which we might obtain by careful observations. I shall mention
a few deductions from Einstein&#x2019;s formulæ.
</p>
<p>1. If a heavy particle is put at the center of a circle, and, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>the length of the circumference and the length of the diameter are measured, it will
be found that their ratio is not &#x3c0; (3.14159). In other words the geometrical properties
of space in such a gravitational field are not those discussed by Euclid; the space
is, then, non-Euclidean. There is no way by which this deduction can be verified,
the difference between the predicted ratio and &#x3c0; is too minute for us to hope to make
our measurements with sufficient exactness to determine the difference.
</p>
<p>2. All the lines in the solar spectrum should with reference to lines obtained by
terrestrial sources be displaced slightly towards longer wave-lengths. The amount
of displacement predicted for lines in the blue end of the spectrum is about one-hundredth
of an Angstrom unit, a quantity well within experimental limits. Unfortunately, as
far as the testing of this prediction is concerned, there are several physical causes
which are also operating to cause displacement of the spectrum-lines; and so at present
a decision can not be rendered as to the verification. St. John and other workers
at the Mount Wilson Observatory have the question under investigation.
</p>
<p>3. According to Newton&#x2019;s law an isolated planet in its motion around a central sun
would describe, period after period, the same elliptical orbit; whereas Einstein&#x2019;s
laws lead to the prediction that the successive orbits traversed would not be identically
the same. Each revolution would start the planet off on an orbit very approximately
elliptical, but with the major axis of the ellipse rotated slightly in the plane of
the orbit. When calculations were made for the various planets in our solar system,
it was found that the only one which was of interest from the standpoint of verification
of Einstein&#x2019;s formulæ was Mercury. It has been known for a long time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>that there was actually such a change as just described in the orbit of Mercury, amounting
to 574&#x2033; of arc per century; and it has been shown that of this a rotation of 532&#x2033;
was due to the direct action of other planets, thus leaving an unexplained rotation
of 42&#x2033; per century. Einstein&#x2019;s formulæ predicted a rotation of 43&#x2033;, a striking agreement.
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with Einstein&#x2019;s formulæ a ray of light passing close to a heavy piece
of matter, the sun, for instance, should experience a sensible deflection in towards
the sun. This might be expected from &#x201c;general&#x201d; consideration of energy in motion;
energy and mass are generally considered to be identical in the sense that an amount
of energy <i>E</i> has the mass <span class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f119.2.svg" alt="upper E Baseline 1 c squared" title="upper E Baseline 1 c squared" class="f119.2frml"></span> where <i>c</i> is the velocity of light; and consequently a ray of light might fall within the province
of gravitation and the amount of deflection to be expected could be calculated by
the ordinary formula for gravitation. Another point of view is to consider again the
observer inside the compartment falling with the acceleration of the gravitational
field. To him the path of a projectile and a ray of light would both appear straight;
so that, if the projectile had a velocity equal to that of light, it and the light
wave would travel side by side. To an observer outside the compartment, <i>e.g.</i>, to one on the earth, both would then appear to have the same deflection owing to
the sun. But how much would the path of the projectile be bent? What would be the
shape of its parabola? One might apply Newton&#x2019;s law; but, according to Einstein&#x2019;s
formulæ, Newton&#x2019;s law should be used only for small velocities. In the case of a ray
passing close to the sun it was decided that according to Einstein&#x2019;s formula there
should be a deflection of 1&#x2033;.75 whereas Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation predicted half
this amount. Careful plans were made by various astronomers, to investigate this question
at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>the solar eclipse last May, and the result announced by Dyson, Eddington and Crommelin,
the leaders of astronomy in England, was that there was a deflection of 1&#x2033;.9. Of course
the detection of such a minute deflection was an extraordinarily difficult matter,
so many corrections had to be applied to the original observations; but the names
of the men who record the conclusions are such as to inspire confidence. Certainly
any effect of refraction seems to be excluded.
</p>
<p>It is thus seen that the formulæ deduced by Einstein have been confirmed in a variety
of ways and in a most brilliant manner. In connection with these formulæ one question
must arise in the minds of everyone; by what process, where in the course of the mathematical
development, does the idea of mass reveal itself? It was not in the equations at the
beginning and yet here it is at the end. How does it appear? As a matter of fact it
is first seen as a constant of integration in the discussion of the problem of the
gravitational field due to a single particle; and the identity of this constant with
mass is proved when one compares Einstein&#x2019;s formulæ with Newton&#x2019;s law which is simply
its degenerated form. This mass, though, is the mass of which we become aware through
our experiences with weight; and Einstein proceeded to prove that this quantity which
entered as a constant of integration in his ideally simple problem also obeyed the
laws of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum when he investigated the
problems of two and more particles. Therefore Einstein deduced from his study of gravitational
fields the well-known properties of matter which form the basis of theoretical mechanics.
A further logical consequence of Einstein&#x2019;s development is to show that energy has
mass, a concept with which every one nowadays is familiar.
</p>
<p>The description of Einstein&#x2019;s method which I have given so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>far is simply the story of one success after another; and it is certainly fair to
ask if we have at last reached finality in our investigation of nature, if we have
attained to truth. Are there no outstanding difficulties? Is there no possibility
of error? Certainly, not until all the predictions made from Einstein&#x2019;s formulæ have
been investigated can much be said; and further, it must be seen whether any other
lines of argument will lead to the same conclusions. But without waiting for all this
there is at least one difficulty which is apparent at this time. We have discussed
the laws of nature as independent in their form of reference axes, a concept which
appeals strongly to our philosophy; yet it is not at all clear, at first sight, that
we can be justified in our belief. We can not imagine any way by which we can become
conscious of the translation of the earth in space; but by means of gyroscopes we
can learn a great deal about its rotation on its axis. We could locate the positions
of its two poles, and by watching a Foucault pendulum or a gyroscope we can obtain
a number which we interpret as the angular velocity of rotation of axes fixed in the
earth; angular velocity with reference to what? Where is the fundamental set of axes?
This is a real difficulty. It can be surmounted in several ways. Einstein himself
has outlined a method which in the end amounts to assuming the existence on the confines
of space of vast quantities of matter, a proposition which is not attractive. deSitter
has suggested a peculiar quality of the space to which we refer our space-time coordinates.
The consequences of this are most interesting, but no decision can as yet be made
as to the justification of the hypothesis. In any case we can say that the difficulty
raised is not one that destroys the real value of Einstein&#x2019;s work.
</p>
<p>In conclusion I wish to emphasize the fact, which should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>be obvious, that Einstein has not attempted any explanation of gravitation; he has
been occupied with the deduction of its laws. These laws, together with those of electromagnetic
phenomena, comprise our store of knowledge. There is not the slightest indication
of a mechanism, meaning by that a picture in terms of our senses. In fact what we
have learned has been to realize that our desire to use such mechanisms is futile.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first xd29e173"><span class="sc">Sir Frank Dyson</span><br>
the Astronomer Royal
</p>
<p>The purpose of the expedition was to determine whether any displacement is caused
to a ray of light by the gravitational field of the sun, and if so, the amount of
the displacement. Einstein&#x2019;s theory predicted a displacement varying inversely as
the distance of the ray from the sun&#x2019;s center, amounting to 1&#x2033;.75 for a star seen
just grazing the sun.&#x2026;
</p>
<p><a id="xd29e1608"></a>A study of the conditions of the 1919 eclipse showed that the sun would be very favorably
placed among a group of bright stars&#x2014;in fact, it would be in the most favorable possible
position. A study of the conditions at various points on the path of the eclipse,
in which Mr. Hinks helped us, pointed to Sobral, in Brazil, and Principe, an island
off the west coast of Africa, as the most favorable stations.&#x2026;
</p>
<p>The Greenwich party, Dr. Crommelin and Mr. Davidson, reached Brazil in ample time
to prepare for the eclipse, and the usual preliminary focusing by photographing stellar
fields was carried out. The day of the eclipse opened cloudy, but cleared later, and
the observations were carried out with almost complete success. With the astrographic
telescope Mr. Davidson secured 15 out of 18 photographs showing the required stellar
images. Totality lasted 6 minutes, and the average exposure of the plates was 5 to
6 seconds. Dr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>Crommelin with the other lens had 7 successful plates out of 8. The unsuccessful plates
were spoiled for this purpose by the clouds, but show the remarkable prominence very
well.
</p>
<p>When the plates were developed the astrographic images were found to be out of focus.
This is attributed to the effect of the sun&#x2019;s heat on the coelostat mirror. The images
were fuzzy and quite different from those on the check-plates secured at night before
and after the eclipse. Fortunately the mirror which fed the 4-inch lens was not affected,
and the star images secured with this lens were good and similar to those got by the
night-plates. The observers stayed on in Brazil until July to secure the field in
the night sky at the altitude of the eclipse epoch and under identical instrumental
conditions.
</p>
<p>The plates were measured at Greenwich immediately after the observers&#x2019; return. Each
plate was measured twice over by Messrs. Davidson and Furner, and I am satisfied that
such faults as lie in the results are in the plates themselves and not in the measures.
The figures obtained may be briefly summarized as follows: The astrographic plates
gave 0&#x2033;.97 for the displacement at the limb when the scale-value was determined from
the plates themselves, and 1&#x2033;.40 when the scale-value was assumed from the check plates.
But the much better plates gave for the displacement at the limb 1&#x2033;.98, Einstein&#x2019;s
predicted value being 1&#x2033;.75. Further, for these plates the agreement was all that
could be expected.&#x2026;
</p>
<p>After a careful study of the plates I am prepared to say that there can be no doubt
that they confirm Einstein&#x2019;s prediction. A very definite result has been obtained
that light is deflected according to Einstein&#x2019;s law of gravitation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p class="xd29e173"><span class="sc">Professor A.&nbsp;S. Eddington</span><br>
Royal Observatory
</p>
<p>Mr. Cottingham and I left the other observers at Madeira and arrived at <i>Principe</i> on April 23.&#x2026; We soon realized that the prospect of a clear sky at the end of May
was not very good. Not even a heavy thunderstorm on the morning of the eclipse, three
weeks after the end of the wet season, saved the situation. The sky was completely
cloudy at first contact, but about half an hour before totality we began to see glimpses
of the sun&#x2019;s crescent through the clouds. We carried out our program exactly as arranged,
and the sky must have been clearer towards the end of totality. Of the 16 plates taken
during the five minutes of totality the first ten showed no stars at all; of the later
plates two showed five stars each, from which a result could be obtained. Comparing
them with the check-plates secured at Oxford before we went out, we obtained as the
final result from the two plates for the value of the displacement of the limb 1&#x2033;.6
± 0.3.&#x2026; This result supports the figures obtained at Sobral.&#x2026;
</p>
<p>I will pass now to a few words on the meaning of the result. It points to the larger
of the two possible values of the deflection. The simplest interpretation of the bending
of the ray is to consider it as an effect of the weight of light. We know that momentum
is carried along on the path of a beam of light. Gravity in acting creates momentum
in a direction different from that of the path of the ray and so causes it to bend.
For the half-effect we have to assume that gravity obeys Newton&#x2019;s law; for the full
effect which has been obtained we must assume that gravity obeys the new law proposed
by Einstein. This is one of the most crucial tests between Newton&#x2019;s law and the proposed
new law. Einstein&#x2019;s law had already indicated a perturbation, causing the orbit of
Mercury to revolve. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>That confirms it for relatively small velocities. Going to the limit, where the speed
is that of light, the perturbation is increased in such a way as to double the curvature
of the path, and this is now confirmed.
</p>
<p>This effect may be taken as proving Einstein&#x2019;s <i>law</i> rather than his <i>theory</i>. It is not affected by the failure to detect the displacement of Fraunhofer lines
on the sun. If this latter failure is confirmed it will not affect Einstein&#x2019;s law
of gravitation, but it will affect the views on which the law was arrived at. The
law is right, though the fundamental ideas underlying it may yet be questioned.&#x2026;
</p>
<p>One further point must be touched upon. Are we to attribute the displacement to the
gravitational field and not to the refracting matter around the sun? The refractive
index required to produce the result at a distance of 15&#x2032; from the sun would be that
given by gases at a pressure of 1&#x2044;60&#x200b; to 1&#x2044;200&#x200b; of an atmosphere. This is of too great
a density considering the depth through which the light would have to pass.
</p>
<p class="xd29e173"><span class="sc">Sir J.&nbsp;J. Thomson</span><br>
President of the Royal Society
</p>
<p>&#x2026; If the results obtained had been only that light was affected by gravitation, it
would have been of the greatest importance. Newton, did, in fact, suggest this very
point in his &#x201c;Optics,&#x201d; and his suggestion would presumably have led to the half-value.
But this result is not an isolated one; it is part of a whole continent of scientific
ideas affecting the most fundamental concepts of physics.&#x2026; This is the most important
result obtained in connection with the theory of gravitation since Newton&#x2019;s day, and
it is fitting that it should be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>announced at a meeting of the society so closely connected with him.
</p>
<p>The difference between the laws of gravitation of Einstein and Newton come only in
special cases. The real interest of Einstein&#x2019;s theory lies not so much in his results
as in the method by which he gets them. If his theory is right, it makes us take an
entirely new view of gravitation. If it is sustained that Einstein&#x2019;s reasoning holds
good&#x2014;and it has survived two very severe tests in connection with the perihelion of
mercury and the present eclipse&#x2014;then it is the result of one of the highest achievements
of human thought. The weak point in the theory is the great difficulty in expressing
it. It would seem that no one can understand the new law of gravitation without a
thorough knowledge of the theory of invariants and of the calculus of variations.
</p>
<p>One other point of physical interest arises from the discussion. Light is deflected
in passing near huge bodies of matter. This involves alterations in the electric and
magnetic field. This, again, implies the existence of electric and magnetic forces
outside matter&#x2014;forces at present unknown, though some idea of their nature may be
got from the results of this expedition.
